EventRanker
===========

This is a Project for CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence at Georgia Tech. It involves ranking topic clusters based on PageRank to find the most influential events.

project.py contains the main code which consolidates all the data and builds feature vectors. We need to implement K means, get clusters, find cumulative edge weights between every one of them and then select the most influential cluster or event.
