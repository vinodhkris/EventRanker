<p>TWO Christmases ago the director <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/193696/Bryan-Singer?inline=nyt-per" title="">Bryan Singer</a> was looking for a modestly scaled movie to make, something he could slide in quickly between behemoths. </p> <p class="caption">
Bryan Singer, director of Valkyrie, which opens Christmas Day after several delays and much speculation and gossip. 
</p> <p>He had just come off three consecutive comic-book adaptations (<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=55649;187123&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">“X-Men”</a> in 2000, its sequel in 2003 and <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/316298/Superman-Returns/overview">“Superman Returns”</a> in 2006), he had helped to create the hit Fox series <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=23324;376689;23323;429556;201760;146852;135667&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">“House,”</a> and he was now in the market for something different. When he read <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/392441/Valkyrie/overview">“Valkyrie,”</a> a script co-written by <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/192065/Christopher-McQuarrie?inline=nyt-per" title="">Christopher McQuarrie</a>, who had been a friend since high school and won an Academy Award for writing Mr. Singer’s most acclaimed movie, <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/133590/The-Usual-Suspects/overview">“The Usual Suspects”</a> (1995),  he knew he had found that change of pace. </p> <p>Two years, a reported $90 million, half a dozen Internet-fueled controversies and the arrival of one big movie star-turned-mini-mogul later, “Valkyrie,” with an eye-patched and jackbooted <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/86295/Tom-Cruise?inline=nyt-per" title="">Tom Cruise</a> as Col.  Claus von Stauffenberg, the leader of a failed attempt within the German military to kill <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/adolf_hitler/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Adolf Hitler.">Hitler</a> in 1944, arrives in theaters on Dec. 25. </p> <p>“This was my shot at a small movie, and I blew it,” Mr. Singer said with a laugh during a Thanksgiving week visit to New York. “Maybe I just discovered I’m a big-movie guy. Even when I was making ‘Usual Suspects,’ which I shot in 35 days for $6 million, I had to have this giant boat, this police car, explosions, all that stuff. No matter what the circumstances are I tend to amplify.”</p> <p>The film’s subject matter alone promised that “Valkyrie” would receive plenty of attention, given the danger of its being used to create the countermyth of a widespread German resistance. But the oppressive scrutiny of every aspect of the movie’s making probably became inevitable the moment Mr. Singer and Mr. McQuarrie, who are also two of the film’s producers, took the script to United Artists, which MGM had revived for Mr. Cruise as a boutique label. </p> <p>Once Mr. Singer found himself making a Tom Cruise movie, it became hard for anything to happen quietly. </p> <p>In June 2007, shortly before several months of production in Germany were to commence, German officials, distressed by Mr. Cruise’s connection to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/church_of_scientology/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, banned the filmmakers from using certain essential locations, including the Defense Ministry. (The officials eventually relented.) A lawsuit filed by 11 extras playing German soldiers who were injured when they spilled out of the back of a truck made headlines too. </p> <p>Release dates  June 2008, October 2008, February 2009  were changed more often and more publicly than any filmmaker would like. And more recent speculation about “Valkyrie” has centered on things like a change in the advertising campaign that appears to de-emphasize Mr. Cruise and rumors of nonexistent reshoots. (The film did return to production months after shooting wrapped in Germany, but only to film a long-postponed opening set in the Tunisian desert.)</p> <p>The movie’s stock has seemed to crest and crash with every fluctuation in the much-discussed fortunes of United Artists and Mr. Cruise. Intended to produce four films a year, the studio to date has released only one, <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/380101/Lions-for-Lambs/overview">“Lions for Lambs,”</a> which opened in late 2007 to a chilly critical and commercial reception. And Paula Wagner, Mr. Cruise’s longtime producing partner, is no longer running the studio. </p> <p>The nonstop chatter is enough to make Mr. Singer, who is a slightly built and boyish-looking 43, amiably guarded in the presence of a reporter. </p> <p>“It’s a terrible problem, and I’m not saying that selfishly,” Mr. Singer said about the advance scrutiny. “I understand that there is an excitement about knowing something about the making of a movie, even something dramatic or scandalous. But it’s very hard to have the experience of being transported when your mind is full of what you read, very often from a not-credible source.”</p> <p>That willingness to enter the film’s world on its own terms will be particularly crucial for “Valkyrie.” Although the history it recounts is well known in Germany, it’s less familiar to audiences in the United States. </p> <p>Mr. McQuarrie, who composited characters and collapsed timelines to streamline his historical narrative, said that when he first became interested in the Stauffenberg story, he was told, “You can’t make a World War II movie with no American soldiers in it,” let alone one about a conspiracy whose outcome is a foregone conclusion. (Spoiler alert: Hitler lives.) He said he took it as a challenge.</p> <p>It wasn’t the only one the movie would present. “Valkyrie” asks its viewers not only to buy Mr. Cruise as a German officer but also to accept that he and his co-stars  among them the British actors <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/76333/Tom-Wilkinson?inline=nyt-per" title="">Tom Wilkinson</a> and <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/82784/Kenneth-Branagh?inline=nyt-per" title="">Kenneth Branagh</a> and Carice van Houten, who is Dutch  speak in their own accents. The accent question is one that continues to bedevil directors of World War II movies. The Nazis in the current release <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/449752/The-Boy-in-the-Striped-Pajamas/overview">“The Boy in the Striped Pajamas”</a>  deploy clipped British accents straight out of <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=7102;387894&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">“Brideshead Revisited,”</a> and the Polish and Byelorussian freedom fighters in <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/118079/Edward-Zwick?inline=nyt-per" title="">Edward Zwick</a>’s forthcoming <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=399982;13107;291110;437497;156560&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">“Defiance”</a> use Lithuanian inflections. “If everyone was trying to do German accents, the risk of it feeling false was really high,” Mr. Singer said of his film. “It would make no sense. Why would they be speaking in German accents? They’re German.” </p> <p>Nazis are something of a leitmotif in the work of Mr. Singer (who, like Mr. McQuarrie and the film’s publicists, takes pains to point out that Stauffenberg was not one). His 1998 suspense film <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/131958/Apt-Pupil/overview">“Apt Pupil,”</a> based on a novella by <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/97473/Stephen-King?inline=nyt-per" title="">Stephen King</a>, depicts the creepily sadistic relationship between a former SS officer and an American teenager who discovers him living alone in a small town. And it was Mr. Singer’s decision to identify Magneto, the villain of the first X-Men movie, explicitly as a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust. </p> <p>For Mr. Singer, who is Jewish and who grew up in Princeton Junction, N.J., knowing that his adoptive parents “had lost a lot of their family history to the Holocaust,” the fascination with the subject is lifelong and fueled by influences as varied as his elementary-school friendship with two German children and regular early doses of “Hogan’s Heroes.” </p>
