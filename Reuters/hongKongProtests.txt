S'hong kong   as the protests dwindled and life in hong kong returned to its frenetic routine on monday organizers of the biggest prodemocracy political movement in china since the  demonstrations in tiananmen square said they had moved the needle however slightly toward a more democratic future before the movement drew headlines around the world more than a week ago the prospect of meaningful talks between democracy advocates and a government bent on doing beijings will was nonexistent democrats said now preliminary talks have begun and the studentled movement has strengthened the hand of hong kongs democratic lawmakers the power shown by the people in this civil protest is the power of the powerless albert ho the former head of the democratic party and a candidate for chief executive in  said in a telephone interview we have been able at least to create sufficient pressure on the government for the commencement of a dialogue they know that the theme of discussion is political reform previously everybody treated this as a closed chapter although the protest leaders and the remaining participants who still numbered in the low thousands insisted that the socalled umbrella revolution was a longterm project that was far from over there was a sense on monday of a winding down and after  days of street protests a dissipation of energy im very very very tired said dennis chan  letting out a sigh as he prepared to go home after  days at the sitin near the government center we all are it wont end today but maybe tomorrow maybe later too when there are fewer and fewer people he added its hard to say that weve won this battle but its been positive in making pressure on the government to open a conversation with the students even the protest leaders as they began to reflect on what the movement achieved and where it failed were already adopting the past tense all gates were closed before yvonne leung a spokeswoman for the hong kong federation of students said in a phone interview we have now won some space for dialogue and weve seen a growth in our civil society the people used to be unaware of their own power but now they know on monday the student groups that are the driving force behind the protests honored a commitment to clear the barricades enough to allow civil servants to return to work by early monday morning all entrances to the main government office complex were open and workers were streaming in protesters remained at the camps and some roads remained blocked at the two main protest sites  at the city government offices downtown and in the mong kok neighborhood across the harbor  but just steps away it was business as usual in this bustling financial hub despite the lowered tensions the two sides remained far apart and the existence of talks hardly assured their success the official talks between student leaders and the hong kong government led by hong kongs chief secretary carrie lam had not begun but on monday night after two days of preliminary talks their representatives announced that they hoped to begin negotiations this week though they had not yet agreed on the subjects the protesters are pushing the central government to revisit a decision made in late august by chinas parliament the national peoples congress that effectively limited candidates for hong kongs highest office the chief executive to those approved by a probeijing panel mr ho who along with founders of the protest movement is advising the student leaders in the talks said beijing and hong kong needed to go back to the drawing board and include the views of the democratic protest movement in a report to the national peoples congress everything is in the hands of beijing he said but the government has all but ruled out such a reset two hong kong government officials said that the current process for drafting a new elections law already called for a round of public consultations but was limited to how a nominating committee would be structured the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was highly unlikely that the hong kong government would agree to revisit the decision of the national peoples congress that demand by the students and democratic lawmakers is unrealistic they said sooner or later its going to sink in with them that what theyre asking for theyre just not going to get one of the officials said moreover the talks provide a useful delay for the government helping to sap the energy of the protests without promising a meaningful compromise michael tien a probeijing member of the legislative council in hong kong said that was a conscious element of the governments strategy time is on the governments side he said in a telephone interview the talks keep the occupy movement under certain constraints so that it really doesnt affect the daytoday business in hong kong in a brief televised speech on monday evening however hong kongs chief executive leung chunying said the government was sincere in its desire to hold talks with the students he also appealed for the protesters still in mong kok to leave and said that for peoples personal safety and to prevent violent crimes the police would take action at an appropriate time the protesters demands include mr leungs resignation an open election for chief executive with no vetting committee on nominations and a chance to revisit the entire process that led to the national peoples congress decision mr tien said the students should focus on realistic goals like working to adjust the composition of the nominating committee yet in a sign of the gulf that lies between even the more realistic positions of the two camps mr ho said that mr tiens suggestion was off the table we are totally uninterested in it mr ho said for the diehard protesters political realism is not necessarily the goal belief is the only reason to be here even if its not realistic belief said paul cheung  a sales manager who was sitting on a concrete divider in the middle of nathan road normally a major thoroughfare in mong kok you must speak out for what you believe in and then the changes will always take time'

VOrganizers of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong say they have moved the needle toward more democratic future as protests dwindle and life returns to its normal routine; there is sense that after 11 days of street protests that movement has experienced dissipation of energy, despite insistence on part of organizers that movement is long-term project.

S'hong kong   as dusk settled over hong kong regina ip glanced out of the window of her office in the legislative council building eight floors below students chanted slogans as they prepared to escalate the boycott that within  hours would turn into the most momentous demonstrations on chinese soil since the tiananmen protests in beijing a quartercentury ago we have an identity crisis ms ip said in an interview last week these young people they are congregating outside theres a lot of problems with them  their sense of identity how come they cannot identify themselves with china squaring hong kongs british colonial heritage with its reality as a part of china is a problem that ms ip student of elizabethan poetry former colonial official and now probeijing lawmaker in hong kongs legislature has been tackling for decades her seesaw intellectual struggle in many ways mirrors hong kongs and she says wants to build an effective democratic system that fits hong kongs reality rule by beijing ms ip is one of the few establishment figures seeking to meet with leaders of the occupy central movement to find a way to end the protests that have caught the worlds attention if you see it in a positive light its another demonstration of our tradition of largescale peaceful protests if we can resolve it peacefully she said on thursday she said she might run for hong kongs top post in  seeking to replace the increasingly unpopular incumbent leung chunying for ms ip  the path of compromise was not always the natural choice more than a decade ago as hong kongs top security official she led the governments push to pass a law on subversion and treason her efforts to ram the bill through the legislature despite widespread concern that it would erode the citys civil liberties ended in failure and her resignation in  she was also hobbled by her public statements at one point remarking that democracy helped hitlers rise to power in germany in the s and led to the subsequent holocaust and that it was not a panacea for all problems she later said she regretted making that comparison but maintained that the point about democracy not being a cureall was a valid one it was an unusual remark coming from someone who in the s as a civil servant under the british helped set up some of hong kongs first democratic institutions  elections for local councils she then went to stanford university and took a seminar on democracy taught by two prominent scholars on the subject seymour martin lipset and larry diamond and after her resignation in  she went to stanford again that time to study under mr diamond for a masters degree her thesis was on how to build democracy in hong kong she came here very burned and kind of wanting to withdraw and contemplate and kind of recovered some political creativity and energy mr diamond said in an interview and as a result of her thinking began to develop what she thought was some kind of middle way or independent path that could navigate this difficult contradiction between hopes for greater popular sovereignty in hong kong and a pace and level of reform that beijing could be comfortable with in her masters thesis ms ip argued for a stronger political party system in hong kong and a chief executive much like in the united states who was also a party leader giving him or her more authority she viewed democracy as more of a tool than anything  a mechanism to help hong kongs leader govern more effectively she concluded in the thesis that if this opportunity is seized to good effect the spinoffs for the future democratization of china are immeasurable now though she makes it clear that democracy has to be more than something nice to have in principle  it has to deliver while i fully support and understand the normative justifications for a democratic system having seen hong kongs democratic transformation the big question in my mind is in what way more democracy added value ms ip said in the interview after returning to hong kong she quickly set out to enter the public arena again this time in the legislative council in  she stood for election facing her onetime boss anson chan the former chief secretary of hong kong mrs chan who won said in an interview that a desire to keep ms ip out of the legislative council helped her decide to run quite frankly with her background with her beliefs and with her character i thought it would be sending to the community of hong kong quite a wrong message about democracy mrs chan said in an interview i also knew particularly with the entire communist machinery behind her the only person who stands a chance of defeating her is me so thats why i decided to run mrs chan said she did not think that ms ip really believed in democracy saying a leopard doesnt change its spots ms ip ran again in  successfully and has been in the legislature since ms ip studied the works of the thcentury english poet philip sidney at the university of glasgow soon after she was recruited in london to serve in hong kongs colonialera civil service she speaks of the british colonial administrators with admiration  unusual because chinese officials often view those who rose through the ranks of the british system with suspicion my british bosses they actually governed hong kong in accordance with confucian values she said noting that she received commendations from several colonial governors is hong kong chinese or is hong kong western she asked it is in our interest to be both it is her affection for chinese culture and passion for order and authority that may draw her toward beijing her website features a picture of former prime minister zhu rongji giving her a thumbs up during a meeting in brussels in  when she was hong kongs top security official and like other probeijing officials and lawmakers here she acknowledges beijings authority she rattled off the names of senior officials she had just met in beijing where she had taken a delegation of business executives quoting several of them in mandarin the reality in hong kong naturally is we are part of china she said you cant really go against beijing'

S're chinas crackdown in hong kong editorial oct  exactly how far is it reasonable to expect china to go in allowing hong kong to live in its own little universe the  years designated for one country two systems are meant for hong kong to get used to the idea that it is now part of china and this is exactly the sore point many hong kong people simply do not want to be part of mainland china rather than cherishing the privileges enjoyed at the moment they decry any involvement by china an identity crisis rather than a desperate wish for democracy lies at the heart of the current uprising josephine bersee hong kong it is essential that the people of hong kong be given all possible support to prevail against beijing in their struggle hillary clintons  remark regarding chinas growing economic power  how do you deal toughly with your banker  misses the mark the entire history of democratic movements is one of demanding and getting freedom from the banker that owns you nathaniel scoble los angeles re governments plan wait patiently for tide to turn news oct  the hong kong governments strategy of waiting them out is sure to fail hong kong citizens are furious that genuine democracy for which they have fought for years is being denied to them they have lost any remaining trust in the government and in the chinese communist party they wont back down until their demands are met if the hong kong government upheld the freedoms guaranteed by the basic law todays disorders would not be happening derek tan hong kong many of us in the west quietly wish for the status quo in china the fear is that too much democracy there could be unfavorable to the advanced countries of the world leading to political instability in the region also it would likely result in a greater global influence for chinese business leaders and money mandarins and an even more rapid growth of excessive environmentally destructive consumerism in that leviathan population we see that excess now but would it not expand to completely insupportable proportions if the chinese adopted true democracy it may be that for the larger world just a little bit of democracy in china goes a long way lg eaglesham owen sound ontario re hong kong people opinion sept  by louisa lim in addition to a lack of democracy gaping inequality and social injustice stemming from government policies we can now add the indiscriminate use of pepper spray and tear gas on unarmed students by the hong kong police as another reason for the growing anger in hong kong wl chang hong kong what is happening now in hong kong is the result of a power struggle in the chinese communist party if president xi jinping orders the hong kong police to violently end the protests history will condemn him but if he does not take a hard line then he will be criticized by a key rival former president jiang zemin it is quite possible that the protests will end up splitting the communist party in the meantime the international community must do all it can to avert a bloody crackdown william lam hong kong'

S'hong kong   a hong kong hedge fund manager who rallied support from bankers and brokers for the citys prodemocracy movement said tuesday that a leading business newspaper had dropped his longrunning column the hedge fund manager edward c k chin revealed the decision by the hong kong economic journal two days after the chinese government roundly rejected the movements demands he and his supporters said the action was the latest blow to hong kongs beleaguered media freedoms a criticism the paper rejected the dispute was another sign of raw tempers in hong kong where politics business and the news media have increasingly felt the gravitational pull of beijing mr chin has been one of the financial sectors prominent supporters of the movement occupy central with love and peace the group said sunday that it would stage peaceful protests in central the financial heart of hong kong after china proposed electoral changes for the city that would doom activists demands for democracy mr chin had used his weekly column in the economic journal a chineselanguage broadsheet read by bankers and investors to push for fullfledged democracy and to criticize chinas handling of hong kong he said he was informed by email over the weekend that the paper would stop using his column which he wrote for more than eight years as part of a redesign of the business section in which it appeared he rejected that explanation and said that pressure from china possibly indirect appeared to lie behind his dismissal its a political decision he said tuesday its highly political to ax my column right now he added they know my prodemocracy stance the economic journal denied that the move was politically motivated we respect the columnists freedom of expression but media also have room for editorial autonomy a journal spokeswoman said in an emailed statement the statement said the decision to remove mr chins column was part of an editorial redesign planned over two months that also affected other columnists this is something that papers do all the time it said the economic journal is owned by an offshore trust established by richard li a hong kong businessman mr li is the son of the citys and asias richest man li kashing who has extensive investments in china since returning to chinese sovereignty in  hong kong a former british colony has existed under a one country two systems arrangement that preserves its independent legal system and freedoms unavailable in mainland china but that arrangement has come under increasing pressure from the mainlands economic and political influence and many journalists have said that the citys news outlets are especially vulnerable to that influence in february a former chief editor of ming pao a respected chineselanguage newspaper with a tradition of independence suffered grievous injuries in a cleaver attack the police have yet to provide an explanation for the attack although suspects have been arrested last week officers from hong kongs anticorruption agency searched the home of jimmy lai a combative media magnate who has long supported the democracy movement members of the british parliament are preparing to hold hearings about hong kong including the electoral changes and the one country two systems arrangement which derives from a treaty reached between britain and china in  on tuesday qin gang a spokesman for the chinese ministry of foreign affairs told a regular news conference in beijing that chinese officials had raised objections hong kong is chinas internal affair and no interference by external forces will be tolerated mr qin said the independent commentators association a hong kong group that advocates media freedom and diversity said the economic journal could not escape suspicion that political pressure from the mainland authorities and their hong kong allies had influenced its decision we wont speculate on the economic journals motives for its remake the association said in a statement but the objective fact is that the economic journal has proportionally speaking lost the columns of someone who supports the views of occupy central mr chin said he and other occupy central supporters from the financial sector would consider setting up an independent news outlet perhaps a website that would make another economic journal the dropping of mr chins column comes as occupy central tries to sustain public commitment to its protest plans while also trying to shift focus from the failed demands for electoral democracy to broader longterm hopes of preserving hong kongs freedoms and civil society democratic reform in terms of elections in terms of a change in the system may not be possible in the coming eight to  years chan kinman an associate professor of sociology at the chinese university of hong kong and a cofounder of occupy central said tuesday thats why we need to create a resistance movement that can protect our core values'

S'hong kong   the prodemocracy demonstrations that paralyzed blocks of downtown hong kong for nearly two weeks have dissipated to a few hardy thousand but for reasons many residents cannot comprehend the streets are still impassable the battle for territory between the studentled prodemocracy demonstrators and the beijingbacked city government has come down to a strange standoff over the metal barricades themselves set up on the streets and then virtually abandoned by protesters the students insist they remain while the government is afraid to touch them fearing a backlash that will inflame and reenergize the protests senior government officials dont want to give them any excuse that the government is taking things by force said a person involved in the governments decisionmaking who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate political nature of the situation with any action by the government in this area they will call out people to resist and then there would be another incident and we dont want to do that the person said they can call out people in a minute the government learned this lesson when it sent the riot police to quell a protest of several thousand students on sept  the images of the police firing tear gas and pepper spray at the students prompted tens of thousands of angry residents to join them the next day the demonstrators commandeered the waisthigh steel grilles that had been left outside by the police in anticipation of the protest lashed them together and sealed off a network of major arteries mainly in the admiralty district including long stretches of two eightlane avenues they limited traffic to delivery vehicles fire trucks and ambulances all other traffic above ground in these areas including passenger cars and the citys yearold tram system was shut down the blockaded territory far exceeds that taken by the occupy wall street movement in  which took over a small park in lower manhattan a rough parallel would be if protesters in new york shut down times square and columbus circle in manhattan along with a chunk of downtown brooklyn across the east river as the police stood by too worried to clear the streets a week ago the roadway inside the barricades was packed with protesters now it is nearly empty for at least a quartermile most barricades are guarded by only a handful of people and some by none at all ellen ng  a retired lecturer in management was one of two people midafternoon wednesday guarding a barricade on the eastbound four lanes of queensway in admiralty an area studded by skyscrapers and hotels with the heart of the protest blocks away at the government buildings near the waterfront ms ng said the continued closing of queensway and the tram which has upended the commutes of thousands made no sense i asked why this isnt reopened she said but of course i dont have the decisionmaking power instead she is the advance guard in defending the structures on wednesday afternoon after a group of transportation company executives crossed the barricades on queensway hoping to persuade the students to open the road she ran to meet them other volunteers called for backup on walkietalkies by the time the executives had walked one block up the road a platoon of about  students came in from their right flank from the direction of the main protest area filling the formerly empty roadway this is the front line the defensive line for protecting the students inside said one volunteer endy chan  a social worker who was wearing a captain america tank top and jean shorts we are foreseeing the police will come through this road it is the same story at the other major protest site across victoria harbor in kowloon there lee yiklun  a worker for a pharmaceutical factory has been stationed at the barricades at the bustling junction of mong kok road and nathan road some men tried to destroy them yesterday afternoon he said all we did was shout out someones touching our barricades then a hundred protesters literally ran here to protect them when asked about the possibility of removing them the chief spokesman of the hong kong police hui chuntak voiced caution at a news conference on wednesday before taking action the police must review the overall picture and do a risk analysis he said we have deployed staff to ask protesters to remove barriers and release lanes for emergency vehicles the governments reluctance to have the police haul away even abandoned barriers that are blocking streets much less detain protesters means that the roadway stalemate could continue for days the person involved in the governments decisionmaking said the governments longterm calculation is that continued disruption to everyday life here will reduce public support for the protesters and benefit probeijing political parties in future elections well aware of the inconveniences the blockades across hong kong have caused the yearold activist joshua wong said that the student group scholarism was to distribute leaflets on wednesday night to apologize to people affected by the traffic chaos and to explain that the shortterm occupation of roads is for the longterm fruits of political reform of realizing true universal suffrage nicholas lee  a renovation worker in mong kok said the blockade had impinged on commerce of all sorts from hardware stores to the districts brothels even the mainland prostitutes and pimps are off the streets he said and im sure that over there at the goldfish market  so named for the many aquariums selling goldfish and tropical fish  the goldfish are probably swimming backstrokes now'

S'overnight my childhood home became a battleground the hong kong streets where i grew up morphed into an alarming political flash point with riot police in gas masks firing teargas canisters at prodemocracy protesters many of them defending themselves from the noxious white clouds with little more than umbrellas and plastic wrap having lived for years in beijing researching the legacy of chinas suppression of the tiananmen square protests of  i should not have been shocked after unleashing the army on their own people a quartercentury ago chinas leaders were left with a brooding sense of their own vulnerability and a determination to ensure demonstrations would never again spiral out of control this preoccupation gave birth to a ballooning security apparatus whose mission is corralling and suppressing grassroots protests for chinas leaders the overriding priority is stability no matter the cost i was on a reporting trip to the southwestern city of chengdu in may  when a protest was called and the authorities took the orwellian step of manipulating the calendar to move the weekend in order to head off any trouble saturday and sunday suddenly became workdays while monday and tuesday became the new weekend this past sunday  when the phalanxes of riot police moved aggressively to clear the streets of peaceful protesters  hong kong became just another chinese city it was the moment when the one country two systems formula hong kong was promised on its return to chinese sovereignty in  was finally laid bare as unworkable an editorial in the governmentbacked newspaper global times simply stated the radical activists are doomed hong kongers had been waiting for months to see how beijing would fulfill its promise to allow for universal suffrage in electing the territorys next leader in  last month beijing handed down an order that candidates for chief executive as the top leader is known would have to be nominated by a committee packed with beijing loyalists what causes pause is that so many of the tactics used against the hong kong protesters echo those used in beijing in  indeed in the runup to the weekends protests as hong kongers debated the future of democracy in the territory the statebacked press repeated familiar accusations that hostile foreign forces were whipping up dissatisfaction this culminated in an expos on thursday in the probeijing wen wei po newspaper charging the yearold student leader joshua wong of having ties to the american government and being manipulated by a black hand behind the scenes in an eerie echo of tiananmenera language mr wong said the accusations were false mr wong was just  when he founded the scholarism movement which succeeded in getting the government to withdraw plans to introduce procommunist moral and political education into hong kong schools now his group is at the forefront of the student boycotts of classes  aimed at pressuring beijing to give hong kong citizens genuine universal suffrage the protests which were still growing monday as the government announced the riot police were pulling back have been driven by a new generation of young activists like mr wong for whom social media is both a tool of organization and a means of immediately publicizing each clash with riot police even secondary school students have been participating some taking the symbolic gesture of occupying their school playgrounds another prominent figure forced to deny links to the american government  this time with the cia  was the media baron jimmy lai an outspoken advocate for democracy he was the target of an investigation by the independent commission against corruption after his email was hacked and then leaked revealing large donations to prodemocracy politicians and activists  the timing of the anticorruption investigation  just as debate about political reform was at its zenith  was seen as suspiciously convenient and in a sensational corruption trial last week the man who was once hong kongs secondhighest civil servant rafael hui admitted to taking a payment of almost  million from a beijing official as far back as   so the vaunted political neutrality of  hong kongs civil service trained by colonial administrators is looking somewhat shakier the growing anger in hong kong stems not just from a lack of democracy but also from gaping inequality embodied in government policies perceived to be rigged to benefit the citys billionaires so when president xi jinping responded to the growing discontent by summoning hong kongs business tycoons to beijing last week this further underlined the gaping chasm between the governor and the governed the wealthy elite and the ordinary people the muted response from western capitals has dismayed hong kongs protesters many feel that britain as the former colonial power has failed in its legal and moral responsibility to speak out the foreign and commonwealth office issued an anodyne statement welcoming the confirmation that chinas  objective is for the election of hong kongs chief executive through universal suffrage while noting that it would disappoint some people and on monday the us consulate in hong kong issued a statement saying it supported hong kongers fundamental freedoms such as peaceful assembly and expression yet it would not take sides in the discussion of the islands political development for chinas leaders the accusation that foreign forces are manipulating students is easier to countenance than the idea that hong kongers are standing up for the high degree of autonomy promised to them as students and activists faced off riot police amid the canyons of skyscrapers one popular chant was simply hong kong people hong kong people such an assertion of a separate and distinct identity is anathema to president xi whose xenophobic nationalism can accept only one stateapproved version of what it means to be chinese but even as the protests continue to swell beijing seems to hold all the cards yet even if it succeeds in tamping down the anger in hong kong  which is unlikely  its gains can be fleeting at best the moment that hong kong citizens have been dreading for  years has finally arrived and the ramifications will ripple out to taiwan whose residents are increasingly wary of the idea of reunification as well as to the fringes of beijings empire where it is struggling with suicidal tibetan protests and a murderous ethnic insurgency in the northwestern province of xinjiang hong kong has not yet become another tiananmen but the fact they are being spoken of in the same breath shows how little beijing cares what the rest of the world thinks  louisa lim  is a visiting professor of journalism at the university of michigan and the author of the peoples republic of amnesia tiananmen revisited'

VA Week Dominated by Hong Kong, Ebola and the Secret Service
p574

S'much of the news in this past week was about security and its failures  the untrammeled journey of a man infected with ebola from liberia to europe to texas the lapses of the secret service in protecting the president the vast but seemingly victimless data breach at jpmorgan chase these competed with more heartening  or worrying depending on ones point of view  reports from hong kong where tens of thousands of students and other demonstrators protested the chinese communist partys plan to screen candidates for top hong kong offices under the agreement by which britain turned hong kong over to china in  there are to be free elections for the citys chief executive in  but late in august china declared that the candidates would be vetted essentially undermining the democratic process protesters  dubbed occupy central with love and peace by participants and the umbrella revolution on social media for the ubiquitous umbrellas deployed against tear gas pepper spray and the occasional downpour  poured out in vast numbers occupying key intersections across the crowded city at weeks end the protest began to lose momentum partly from lack of a unified leadership or program and partly under pressure from residents seeking to open blocked thoroughfares the current chief executive leung chunying and his beijing mentors were certain to see that as a victory but the very absence of a coherent organization put the lie to beijings claim that the demonstrations were a conspiracy of antichina forces chinas president xi jinping has made clear that he will not allow westernstyle democracy in hong kong  and certainly not in china where news of the demonstrations was blocked this one is not going away ebola in america  the ability of the ebola virus to leap continents in a single bound was demonstrated by thomas e duncan a liberian who became infected in the countrys capital of monrovia when he accompanied a yearold woman dying of the disease to a hospital  and helped carry her back home when the hospital could find no place for her she died soon after four days after the mission of mercy mr duncan set off on sept  on flights to brussels and on to the united states to visit friends in the large liberian community in dallas he went through screening at the monrovia airport to identify potentially infected travelers  his temperature was taken and he filled out a form saying he had not been in contact with any ebola patients he later said he thought that the woman he helped was having problems with her pregnancy in dallas mr duncan developed the symptoms so feared back in his country the fever sore throat joint pains and headaches of incipient ebola but when he went to the texas health presbyterian hospital on the night of sept  and even after he told officials there that he had just arrived from west africa doctors sent him home he was back in the hospital on sunday and this time the authorities went into high gear an exhaustive search has begun to identify and in some cases to quarantine the  to  people who had been in close contact with mr duncan in dallas mr duncan is now in serious but stable condition authorities in monrovia said they will press charges against him for giving false information at the airport they may fear that others who are potentially infected will also try to make it to europe or to the united states where chances of survival are incomparably better than in monrovia why pay so much attention to one case brought into the united states when so many people are becoming infected and dying in west africa the case of mr duncan is important in that it demonstrates how easily a rampant virus can spread to distant corners of the world the united nations however was quick to warn that isolating affected countries is not the answer both because of the hardships and panic it would create and the need for aid workers to come and go security breach part i  omar j gonzalezs vault over the white house fence and his sprint deep into the presidential mansion raised some urgent questions about the competence of the secret service an agency already battered by a series of wellpublicized faux pas before the feat of mr gonzalez a yearold iraq war veteran an armed security guard with an arrest record got into an elevator with president obama at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta and snapped some pictures and back in  the obamas were said to have been furious when they learned that the service was not immediately aware that shots had been fired at the white house then there were the three agents sent home from the netherlands after one got drunk the night before the president was to arrive and the eight agents fired after allegedly soliciting prostitutes on an official trip to colombia so on tuesday the director of the secret service julia pierson was thoroughly thrashed by congressmen of both parties at a house hearing it wont happen again she pledged but it was too late on wednesday she resigned and joseph clancy a former agent who had been known in the service as father joe for his nononsense demeanor was named acting head one of his first tasks will be to get the secret service off the latenight talk shows example jimmy fallon host of nbcs tonight show says ms pierson is going to miss working at the white house but knowing the secret service she should be able to come back any time she wants security breach part ii j p morgan was not known for thinking small even if its not entirely certain that he actually said if you have to ask the price you cant afford it the successor of the bank he founded jpmorgan chase is the largest in the nation and whoever sneaked into its computers compromised not a paltry million accounts as was initially reported but the accounts of  million households and seven million small businesses the breach was discovered in july but the updated tally was revealed in a securities filing on thursday it surpassed the huge recent data breaches at target and home depot and is a lot more noxious target and home depot involved credit cards a bank has a lot more financial data the puzzling thing is that investigators have found no evidence of looted customer accounts so the motive remains unclear'

VHong Kong\u2019s Democracy Dilemma
p710
sg6
S'hong kong  on sunday the standing committee of chinas national peoples congress issued restrictive guidelines for the election of hong kongs next chief executive in  shorn of its technical details the proposal in effect gives beijing the means to control who could run for the top office in hong kong voters would get to cast a ballot but only for one of just a handful of candidates preselected by the chinese government by endorsing this framework cheung mankwong a veteran politician of hong kongs democratic party wrote china has in truth and in substance reneged on her promise to give hong kong universal suffrage three decades ago when beijing and the british government which was in charge of hong kong then were negotiating the terms of the territorys handover back to china mr cheung was among those who supported reunification on the understanding that hong kong would eventually acquire a fully democratic system now some officials here are urging residents to accept beijings undemocratic proposal they say its version of the onepersononevote proposition however faulty is a bird in hand but other hong kongers rightly suspect that accepting that plan would be like drinking from a poisoned chalice the standing committees announcement sunday certainly came as a shock after weeks of regular largescale protests by prodemocracy groups beijing has made it clear that only someone who loves the country and loves hong kong is acceptable for the top post in hong kong and that screening candidates for that qualification is necessary for chinas national security there are people here according to top officials in beijing who still do not accept hong kongs reunification with china and are conniving with foreign forces to subvert the chinese government using hong kong as a base it does not much matter whether beijing really believes what it says what matters is that what beijing says is an excuse for its uncompromising position and it matters that the people of hong kong now face a dilemma they can either reject the framework proposed by beijing knowing they will be offered no other or they can take it and by validating with a pseudopopular mandate beijings selection of their chief executive allow the chinese government to assume complete control over hong kongs affairs once beijing achieves complete control there is no reason why it would allow hong kongs system to democratize the aggressive administration of the current chief executive cy leung has already been bypassing longestablished good practices and principles without any effective checks and balances it is no secret that beijing is dissatisfied with many features of the hong kong peoples way of life including a free press and an independent judiciary that includes foreign judgesboth institutions have faced political pressure this is largely because the chinese government has very different ideas about the meaning of freedom and the rule of law the premium it places on stability and national security and the degree of stability and security it deems necessary are poles apart from the common values of the hong kong community and to beijing which remains imperial in habit it is intolerable that hong kongs ordinary people should put their will above that of the government the election committee the body with some  members that oversees the election of hong kongs chief executive has largely been under the control of the rich and powerful of beijing and hong kong no doubt the same will be true of the nominating committee that the standing committee of the national peoples congress has just endorsed in fact the proposed system will be worse under current practice a person is eligible to run for chief executive with the support of just  people on the election committee this has allowed the democrats in hong kong to field candidates to challenge the contenders backed by beijing and force beijings proxies to declare an election platform to which they can then be held accountable but under the new framework becoming a candidate will require the endorsement of more than half the members of the nominating committee direct popular election under a one person one vote system is not meaningful if the candidates have been preselected by an undemocratic body with the deck stacked to favor beijings chosen candidate beijing will be careful not to allow a truly competitive election like the one in  between mr leung and former hong kong chief secretary henry tang to happen again democracy is not just the only form of government consistent with citizens rights and freedoms it is also the only form of government that can prevent leaders from becoming so arrogant as to think they can ignore the will of the people as seems to have happened under the current chief executive if there is any virtue to beijings uncompromising position it is to make clear that the people of hong kong could make no worse choice than to accept it the legislators from various prodemocracy parties who currently sit in hong kongs legislative council make up over onethird of that body which gives them the power to veto the election framework put forward by beijing they have pledged to vote against the proposal and the hong kong people will see to it that they do in a huge rally on sunday democratic groups already were declaring a new era of civil disobedience  margaret ng  is a barrister and former legislator of hong kong'

VChinese President Sends Signal Against Political Change in Hong Kong
p774

S'hong kong  president xi jinping of china has used a meeting with some of hong kongs leading industrialists to reinforce beijings unyielding position against political change in the former british colony lending his personal authority to the governments efforts to undermine the prodemocracy movement here and to signal to the citys business elite that it should toe the official line details of the closeddoor meeting which took place monday in beijing with a group of asias wealthiest men emerged as attendees returned to hong kong in recent days four participants said in interviews that mr xi stressed that any political change in hong kong must be in strict accordance with the existing legal code called the basic law in effect mr xi ruled out demands by prodemocracy supporters that would open up the nomination system for hong kongs top position the chief executive they said china regained sovereignty over hong kong in  in an agreement that guaranteed the territory would enjoy considerable freedom to run its own affairs for a halfcentury and the ruling communist party has promised to allow hong kong citizens to vote for the territorys top post in  but last month beijing set down rules that ensured that only candidates acceptable to the central government would be allowed to run for election in response an increasingly assertive prodemocracy movement here vowed to stage sitin protests in central the citys financial district the meeting with hong kongs tycoons who enjoy a combined net worth of tens of billions of dollars took place the same day that thousands of students in hong kong gathered on a university campus to begin a weeklong boycott of classes to protest beijings position many plan to take part in the mass sitin known as occupy central which is expected to start next month maggie chan manki a lawyer who is a member of a probeijing political party in hong kong and attended the meeting with mr xi said that the chinese president specifically mentioned the occupy central movement and stressed that the political reform and development in hong kong should be in accordance with law and within the framework of the law so everything that goes beyond that is prohibited and should not be encouraged ambrose lam the former head of the law society of hong kong who also attended the meeting said that mr xi said political reform in the territory should be in the format suitable to hong kong which he interpreted as a signal that hong kong could not adopt a westernstyle democratic system because of its status as part of china a third participant stanley lau chairman of the federation of hong kong industries said that mr xi told the group that beijing would unswervingly support the hong kong government in dealing with all illegal activities and that the central government stands firm a fourth participant patrick lau saushing a former lawmaker said mr xi emphasized the importance of adhering to the basic law beijing considers the occupy central protests illegal and says that open nominations for chief executive violate the basic law the meeting on monday came as trust in the central government in beijing among the territorys  million people has fallen to its lowest point since february  months before the transfer of sovereignty according to a new poll the poll released tuesday by hong kong university and conducted by telephone from sept  to  also showed that trust in hong kongs own probeijing government had fallen to the lowest point in more than a decade mr xis decision to meet with the business elite appeared to reflect a recognition of hong kongs financial importance to china as well as to signal that chinas communist leadership was allied with business in the official group photograph of the meeting mr xi was placed next to li kashing head of cheung kong holdings and asias wealthiest man with a fortune of  billion according to bloomberg other hong kong executives attending the meeting included the henderson land development chairman lee shaukee and the wharf holdings chairman peter woo kwongching tung cheehwa hong kongs first chief executive after the  handover also attended mr xi directly urged the business leaders to resolutely oppose words and actions that would violate the basic law and harm rule of law in hong kong one participant chan wingkee president of the chinese manufacturers association of hong kong told the probeijing newspaper ta kung pao the meeting highlighted a transformation in the communist partys relationship with hong kong where once its supporters helped organize workers and strikes it now openly courts the citys business elite last month wang zhenmin a top chinese academic who works closely with the government to create policy on hong kong went as far as to say that democracy in hong kong had to be limited to protect the interests of the wealthy one of the reasons people say theyre fighting for democracy is because they really feel that hong kong politics is run in the interest of the tycoons and the wealthy people said david zweig the director of the center on chinas transnational relations at the hong kong university of science and technology here the students are out there fighting for democracy and here is the mainland reinforcing the perception that this is rich mans politics both ms chan and mr lam said that mr xi emphasized to the hong kong business leaders that the one country two systems principle that allows hong kong to enjoy civil liberties unheard of in the mainland was a twoway street and that hong kongs people had to formulate policies that took into account the fact that hong kong was part of china the two systems derive from one country ms chan said we have to face the reality that hong kong is part of china'

S'seventeen years after the handover of hong kong from britain to china the political future of the territory hangs in the balance the city can continue down a path that will lead to a fully democratic political system or beijing can thwart its democratic development and eventually run hong kong like just another chinese city all signs indicate that beijing plans to tighten its grip as increasingly restive hong kongers protest this summer against beijings interference the international community particularly britain the former colonial power has a moral and legal obligation to support their will for democracy and autonomy london should demand that beijing live up to its agreements and back off on july st an estimated half a million people took to the hong kong streets to protest beijings meddling in the days before nearly  hong kongers participated in an informal vote run by a prodemocracy group in support of electing the citys next leader by democratic means a prospect beijing has all but ruled out in recent months the chinese government has made clear that it intends to renege on a promise to allow hong kongers universal suffrage to freely elect their next leader by insisting beijing must vet the candidates for patriotism but it was the release in june of a strongly worded policy paper in which beijing claimed ultimate authority over hong kong that galvanized locals against the mainlands interference the socalled white paper says the high degree of autonomy hong kong was promised in the  joint declaration  signed by britain and china when beijing was trying to assure the world it would leave hong kong alone after the end of british colonial rule  is not full autonomy in blatant disregard of margaret thatchers signature on the joint declaration the white paper claims that beijing can interpret hong kong law as it sees fit the territorys autonomy the paper says derives solely from the authorization of the central leadership perhaps most troubling the document likens beijings authority over hong kong to how it rules other autonomous regions in china  a worrying prospect for anyone familiar with how the leadership treats the people of tibet and xinjiang the situation should not be this bleak as early as  in meetings with british officials deng xiaoping said hong kongers should put their hearts at ease about chinese rule the basic law hong kongs miniconstitution largely fulfilled the legal commitments made in the joint declaration hong kong courts were authorized to interpret the basic law within the scope of hong kongs autonomy while foreign affairs and defense were to be handled by beijing most importantly universal suffrage was to be implemented now the white paper refers to hong kongs judges as administrators and emphasizes their role in guarding national security cracks appeared soon after the handover first the national peoples congress standing committee effectively overturned a  decision by hong kongs highest court in a case about local residency rights raising great concern about hong kongs judicial independence later beijing made central government approval a requirement for any reforms to the legislative council election process and over the past decade the subservient hong kong government has tried to push through unpopular national security laws and policies on patriotic education all abandoned in the face of mass public protests meanwhile a form of crony capitalism is widely thought to be creeping across the border still beijing finally agreed in  to allow universal suffrage to elect the chief executive in  yet in the last year beijing has insisted that nominees must love china and love hong kong  language that is code to exclude the democrats locals feel they have no other choice but to take the cause of democracy to the streets the group occupy central with love and peace has threatened a mass act of civil disobedience in the central financial district if the government does not put forth fair democracy proposals that meet international standards to show support for its position occupy central organized last months vote in which citizens were asked to choose from three democratic proposals for nominating chief executive candidates the next protest its organizers say could happen as early as august if government proposals due out this week aim to block real democratic reform who will stand up for hong kong major international banks and accounting firms are toeing beijings line saying publicly that mass protests will disrupt the citys economy and threaten the peace except for the usual expression of support for credible elections washington and other foreign governments have largely remained silent on beijings latest moves a special onus falls on britain whose flag some hong kongers waved during the july  demonstrations one can only wonder if prime minister david cameron who recently signed a group of major trade deals with china during prime minister li keqiangs visit to london will ever weigh in to uphold his countrys commitment to hong kongs people he should consider the words of his predecessor john major who sought to assure a wary world before hong kong was handed over to the chinese if in the future there were any suggestion of a breach of the joint declaration we would mobilize the international community and pursue every legal or other avenue open to us prime minister major said back in  a year before the handover its clear that time has come  michael c davis is a law professor at the university of hong kong who specializes in constitutional development and human rights'

to respond much more firmly and probably would have hurt broader public support but at an overnight sitin after the march the police removed and arrested  protesters in less than four hours  a brisk pace suggesting that they may be ready to respond to the larger sitins that some democracy advocates are contemplating for this year but while the protesters disproved government warnings that their activities would lead to chaos their civil behavior could also lead to an impression that they are manageable which could limit the pressure they are able to bring to bear the youthfulness of the demonstrators may also make it harder to reach any compromise with the local government and its backers in beijing the main question is who can run to become the territorys chief executive in the next elections in  that issue was front and center for tuesdays march as was the subject of an informal vote last month in which nearly  hong kong residents participated and which beijing dismissed as illegal students and people in their s have overwhelmingly supported a plan calling for the general public to nominate candidates for chief executive  socalled civil nomination an idea rejected by beijing and its allies older hong kong residents have tended to support a compromise that would retain the nominating committee mandated by the basic law the territorys miniconstitution but make that committee more diverse and open to a wider range of candidates than beijing wants asked after a speech on wednesday afternoon whether the political center was eroding in hong kong anson chan the secondhighest official in the hong kong government in the years immediately before and after the british returned the territory to chinese sovereignty in  was blunt i have to say that i agree she replied ms chan one of the most influential advocates of democracy here noted that a prominent prodemocracy member of the citys legislature ronny tong had withdrawn his own plan for reconstituting the nomination committee after concluding that support in the democratic camp for civil nomination was overwhelming ms chan said she still favored a nominating committee with broad rules that would allow a full array of candidates to appear on the ballot not just those approved by beijing she contended that such a procedural compromise would still make it possible to achieve full democratic goals probeijing hardliners here who have criticized the past willingness of hong kong governments to strike compromises with democracy advocates are pleased with the erosion of the political center there is a distinct split in the population of hong kong said lau naikeung one of the six hong kong members of the influential basic law committee which reports to beijing there is no neutral ground either you are for me or against me mr lau said that chinas leaders would never accept civil nomination categorically no chance he said there is no way you can force it on beijing michael degolyer the director of the hong kong transition project a coalition of academics who have been studying the territorys political evolution from a british colony to a chinese territory expressed caution about whether the march was large enough to change political calculations in hong kong or beijing it wasnt this enormous overwhelming turnout that everyone would be stunned by  it was big mr degolyer said organizers estimated that  people joined the march while the police calculated that the largest number of people participating at any one time during the eighthour march was  the police did not try to estimate the total number of participants one lingering question on wednesday after the police removed and arrested participants in the sitin was whether future protests would be as peaceful certainly the police showed a new willingness on wednesday morning to arrest large numbers of people not just push them from the road they were blocking of the  people arrested on wednesday on accusations of obstruction of the police and unlawful assembly  were released with warning notices but  people had to post bail before their release and by sunset the police were still holding  people the probeijing camp was delighted with the crackdown i think this is a wise move because sending out a clear signal will have a better management of public expectations said mr lau the basic law committee member i think it will prevent future troubles the backdrop for the protest was an increasingly repressive political environment in mainland china where detentions of human rights advocates and others have increased as president xi jinping has rapidly consolidated power some demonstrators in hong kong particularly the limited number of older demonstrators indicated that they were seeking a greater political voice at a time when the political climate if anything may be darkening i just try my best by marching even though it may not be of much use gary fong a yearold metalworker said during the protest on tuesday who knows this may be the last year that we will be allowed to march'

S'hong kong   crowds of protesters who filled hong kongs streets with demands for more democracy thinned dramatically tuesday after student leaders and the government agreed to hold talks in the increasingly frustrated city the government and students leaders announced they will begin talks on political reform on friday but while a government representative said negotiations were off to a good start the students expressed anger and disappointment at officials unwillingness to address their real demands just a few days after tens of thousands of demonstrators thronged the citys streets only a couple thousand protesters were scattered across the three main protest areas on tuesday night but the sixlane highway that cuts through the heart of hong kongs business district remained blocked by demonstrators once again snarling traffic and angering many commuters despite the dwindling numbers of activists on the streets protest leaders insisted the movement was far from defeated and vowed to walk away from negotiations if the police used force to clear away the remaining demonstrators michael leung  wearing his school uniform and doing homework on the highway said he had come to the protest zone on three days after school you see now the number of people is decreasing because there has been no big action from the government and the police he said but i think if the government or police want to clear this area then the people will come out again at the territorys government headquarters which had been blocked by protesters for a week only a half dozen or so student protesters remained at the barricades eight policemen stood nearby chatting among themselves on tuesday night a dozen policemen ringed a small group of progovernment demonstrators as they marched near the protesters it is true democracy were looking for one of the demonstrators cried into portable loudspeaker as the group shouted her down many uncertainties remain about how the standoff will be resolved lau kongwah the territorys undersecretary of constitutional affairs said the governments first meeting with students on friday will discuss the details of political reform in a public forum but lester shum a hong kong federation of students leader said the group was disappointed that the government proposed to focus the talks on legal technicalities  a tactic that he said was used to dodge their demand for free elections it shows the government has no sincerity to face hong kongs political problems and the dissatisfaction of the many hong kong people who protested on the streets he said we will continue the occupation protests he added we believe the occupation movement has put very big pressure on the government the dueling questions now are how long the demonstrators are willing to continue their protests  and how long until the government removes them we are safe from a crackdown for the moment said joseph cheng a specialist in chinese politics at the city university of hong kong who has deep ties to the citys prodemocracy movement  now that there are negotiations going on  or at least negotiations to discuss negotiations  we expect that the police will not clear the protesters for a few days but with the authorities unlikely to agree to the protesters immediate demands including the resignation of hong kong chief executive leung chunying any talks could quickly collapse the real test is what happens when the negotiations break down said cheng like many protest leaders cheng suspects the government is purposefully slowing discussions to drive a wedge between the activists and residents increasingly anxious for the protests to end people are now beginning to say hey we want to make a living you are disturbing my daily life he said the protesters are demanding a wider say in the inaugural  elections for hong kongs top official known as the chief executive than chinas central government is willing to give them beijing which controls hong kong but allows far more liberty here than on the mainland insists that all candidates be screened by a committee of mostly prochina tycoons and other elites raising fears of a tightening grip by communist leaders a police spokesman warned tuesday that the chance of further confrontations is increasing in the citys mong kok district where mobs tried to drive away protesters over the weekend the protesters have occupied the road illegally for many days said police spokesman steve hui adding that authorities would take action at the appropriate time earlier crackdowns though have backfired on the government when police fired tear gas and pepper spray on unarmed demonstrators on sept  it caused an upsurge in support for the protesters and brought tens of thousands of hong kong residents into the streets on monday leung the citys chief executive said in a tv address that the government would seek a sincere dialogue on political reform at the same time he urged the end to the blockade of the streets and issued veiled warnings that the authorities would eventually need to restore social order i hope that the protesters gathering on the roads especially students and young people could think this over while fighting for a better future and democracy for hong kong by way of civil disobedience should you also consider the prolonged disruption caused to the general public he said primary schools in districts affected by the protests reopened tuesday a day after high school classes resumed civil servants returned to work after protesters cleared the area outside the city government headquarters a focal point of the demonstrations that began sept  but the citys legislature located in the same complex postponed two meetings on tuesday  associated press writers sylvia hui and joanna chiu contributed to this report'

S'hong kong   for some mainland chinese in hong kong the sight of thousands of people on the streets protesting for greater democracy is an alien one that has prompted comparisons with the relative lack of political freedom back home others are less impressed and see the mass show of defiance as a dangerous tactic that has shut down large parts of the city and raised the risk of serious confrontation with hong kong police for the first time in my life i feel close to politics said a chinese tourist from beijing who gave only her surname yu this is a historic moment for hong kong the yearold added she was among those who had arrived from the mainland to celebrate a oneweek holiday that starts with chinas national day on wednesday i was quite afraid in the beginning but now i firmly support it theres nothing wrong with supporting ones rights with reasonable acts she said she planned to share photographs of the protests with her friends and post them on the internet i believe something like this will happen in china one day that is exactly what the government in beijing wants to avoid and why the unrest in hong kong is such a major challenge chinese communist party leaders worry that calls for democracy could spread to the mainland and they have been aggressively censoring news and social media comments about the hong kong demonstrations the protests are the worst in hong kong since china resumed its rule in  they also represent one of the biggest political tests for beijing since it violently crushed prodemocracy protests in tiananmen square in  li qi in her mids and from the southwestern city of chengdu is too young to remember that bloody episode patriotic education has also ensured that many young chinese have only limited knowledge of that and other protest movements its the first time in my life that ive seen this kind of movement said li who was in hong kong to shop the actual scene is quite well organized and very disciplined not the kind of chaos we would have expected disrespectful overly aggressive tens of thousands of protesters mostly students have taken to the streets over the last five days to demand greater democracy in hong kong they have called on hong kong leader leung chunying to step down after beijing ruled that it would vet candidates wishing to run for hong kongs leadership in  china rules hong kong under a one country two systems formula that accords the former british colony a degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland nonetheless beijing has called the protest movement illegal and for some mainland chinese looking on breaking the law is not the right way to go i support their demands but i dont support their overly aggressive actions to achieve this because i think breaking the law is not good said steven a chinese phd student at the hong kong university of science and technology who only gave his first name others said they were dismayed that hong kong people were ungrateful for the benefits they enjoyed under beijings rule a woman surnamed lin from the southern chinese city of shenzhen who was traveling to hong kong on wednesday to shop said the protesters demands for a democratic election were disrespectful to the mainland even though the government has brought a lot of development to hong kong they dont acknowledge this lin said stunned by the beijing governments harsh response to the tiananmen movement and tired of decades of turmoil under communist rule many chinese people now balk at the idea of mass revolution jennie who grew up in china and runs a hong kongbased charity said she feared that if protests descended into riots there could be a much stronger response from china the communist party has the ability to do it weve seen them do it before and they will do it again she said there are much deeper problems and it will take generations to correct this one protest wont do it additional reporting by alexandra harney in shanghai paul carsten and li hui in beijing writing by suilee wee editing by mike collettwhite'

S'hong kong   prodemocracy demonstrations in hong kong rolled into early tuesday with hundreds of students remaining camped out in the heart of the city after more than a week of rallies and behindthescenes talks showing modest signs of progress studentled protesters early on monday lifted a blockade of government offices that had been the focal point of their action initially drawing tens of thousands onto the streets civil servants were allowed to pass through the protesters barricades unimpeded several streets through downtown hong kong which houses offices for international banks luxury malls and the main stock exchange remained barricaded and vehiclefree although pedestrians could walk freely through the area over the past week tens of thousands of protesters have  demanded that the citys beijingappointed leader leung chunying quit and that china allow hong kong people the right to vote for a leader of their choice in  elections the stalemate appeared late on monday to be nearing a potential turning point however when a senior official said formal talks to address the protesters demands and end the demonstrations may begin later in the week after preparatory discussions with student representatives on monday night lau kongwah the hong kong governments undersecretary of constitutional and mainland affairs said both sides had agreed on general principles for the formal talks i think todays meeting was successful and progress has been made he told reporters we both hope to hold these discussions soon as possible and we hope that we will be able to begin them within this week the occupy central protests an idea conceived over a year ago have presented beijing with one of its biggest political challenges since it crushed prodemocracy demonstrations in and around tiananmen square in the chinese capital in  facing separatist unrest in farflung tibet and xinjiang beijing fears that calls for democracy in hong kong could spread to the mainland the communist party leadership has dismissed the hong kong protests as illegal but has left leungs government to find a solution hard to quit protest leaders have promised to carry on with the occupy demonstrations until their demands are met unless we gain significant achievement then there is no way to quit it has to end when and only when the government promises something otherwise it is impossible to persuade the people to quit said alex chow leader of the hong kong federation of students the pressure generated here will also be delivered to beijing because china still has to rule hong kong and they have to stabilise hong kong how the hong kong government responds to the citizens will affect stability if they handle it in a very adverse way then it will also affect mainland china the protests have ebbed and flowed over the past week with people leaving the streets overnight to return later police have taken a handsoff approach since last sunday when they fired tear gas and pepper spray at protesters creating a public relations mess and provoking more people to join the unrest i hope students can persist if we retreat now we will lose the power to negotiate said chow chinglam who was studying on the ground at the main protest site fearing a crackdown after city leaders called for the streets to be cleared so businesses schools and the civil service could resume on monday protesters who have paralysed parts of the former british colony with mass sitins pulled back from outside leungs office some banks that had closed branches during the unrest of the past week opened for business on monday discrepancies on talks a first meeting to pave the way for formal talks between government officials and student representatives was held on sunday and another was expected on tuesday students said whether we will get results from our discussions depends on the sincerity of the government and their attitude towards the occupying protesters lester shum vice secretary of the hong kong federation of students told a news conference late on monday shum said he hoped the formal talks could start before sunday across victoria harbour in the gritty mong kok neighbourhood some protesters also pulled back from where scuffles had broken out at the weekend with supporters of the government prompting police to use pepper spray and batons again the protests have disrupted businesses and helped wipe close to  billion off the value of shares on the hong kong stock exchange the world bank said the protests were hurting hong kongs economy but the impact on china was limited at this point what we anticipate is obviously a greater impact on the hong kong sar special administrative region so slower growth in  than was being anticipated earlier world bank east asia and pacific chief economist sudhir shetty said on monday but at this stage our best estimates  are that there isnt as yet significant spillover to the broader chinese economy he told a media briefing on the latest east asia pacific economic update additional reporting by clare jim twinnie siu james pomfret clare baldwin joseph campbell yimou lee diana chan kinling lo and venus wu writing

S'hong kong   an unofficial referendum on making the selection of hong kongs chief executive more democratic has attracted votes equal to more than a fifth of the citys electorate organizers said sunday the referendums final day they voiced hopes that the higherthananticipated participation would along with a protest march scheduled for tuesday increase the pressure on the mainland chinese government to give ground on the issue the results released monday showed that an overwhelming majority of participants wants hong kongs legislative council to reject any electoral reform proposal from the government that does not meet the international standards demanded by prodemocratic groups democracy advocates organized the day vote as a political battering ram seeking to force hong kong politicians and chinese communist party officials to heed demands that the election of the chief executive the citys top leader be opened to greater public participation with fewer procedural barriers set in place by beijing the poll attracted valid votes from more than  hong kong residents who used a cellphone app a website or polling booths to choose among three proposals according to an email from the university polling unit that oversaw the vote the vote lacked the safeguards of an official vote but the number was equal to  percent of hong kongs  million registered voters in the last election for the legislative council in  about half the registered voters cast ballots benny tai a legal scholar who has led the referendum effort said he was encouraged although the final tally may go down once double votes  people voting twice on phone apps and the website  are weeded out that is a figure much higher than anyone could have expected including us and the government said mr tai an associate professor of law at the university of hong kong who is a leader of occupy central with love and peace the group that started the referendum i think were seeing some signs that the chinese government understands that the civil referendum even though unofficial is an expression of public opinion that needs to be considered seriously mr tai said in an interview china has promised to allow voting changes for hong kong so that from  the chief executive is chosen through universal suffrage a step provided for in the basic legal framework for the city but democracy activists believe the changes could preserve beijings power to engineer the outcome it wants the occupy organizers have said that if electoral changes fall short of genuine universal suffrage they will hold protests in central a district dense with banks and other businesses the most popular electoral reform proposal attracted  percent of the votes like the other two proposals it allows a candidate to win a place on the ballot for chief executive by gaining endorsement from  percent of registered voters as well  percent of those who participated said the legislative council should veto any electoral plan that cannot satisfy international standards the council has  members and the pandemocrat camp holds  seats enough to veto any changes to the voting laws which require support from twothirds of members the chinese government has repeatedly condemned occupy central and dismissed the referendum as illegal after the vote closed a spokesman for the hong kong government said that a core demand in all three proposals  allowing voters to nominate candidates directly through writeins or similar grassroots initiatives without seeking the nod of a nominating committee  was unlikely to ever win official backing the hong kong government has reiterated many times before that it is unlikely to be adopted in view of the controversies relating to the legal political and operational aspects of the proposal the unidentified spokesman said in a statement issued on the hong kong governments website michael tien a proestablishment member of hong kongs legislative council said monday in an interview that the referendum would have to garner far more votes for the central government in beijing to consider changing its stance on how the chief executive is nominated if instead of  it is three or four million then i think china would completely reassess the situation said mr tien a leader of the new peoples party tensions have been rising in hong kong over the electoral issue and many residents worry that the chinese communist party leadership is seeking to shrink the citys autonomy established under a one country two systems policy agreed upon before the british colony returned to chinese sovereignty in  the next gauge of discontent with government policies in hong kong will come on tuesday the anniversary of the citys return to china and a day every year when democratic groups and other critics of beijing rally we have to wait for the turnout on the first of july mr tai said if we have a very high turnout that again will confirm the message to beijing that hong kong people are really determined to have true democracy he said that this year the organizers of the july  march hoped to see attendance rivaling the  march when hundreds of thousands of people joined in the discontent reflected in the referendum could eventually help induce quiet concessions from beijing said joseph wong wingping a former senior public servant in hong kong who has backed the occupy central movement at the end of the day whether they are prepared to soften up a bit is of course a political judgment which i dont think anyone could arrive at yet mr wong said in an interview but openly you will not hear any soft remarks from the central government'

VUnofficial referendum on making selection of Hong Kong's chief executive more democratic has attracted votes equal to more than a fifth of city\u2019s electorate; hopes are that higher-than-anticipated participation will, along with protest march, increase pressure on mainland Chinese government to give ground on issue.

S'hong kong   democratic lawmakers in hong kong demanded antigraft officers investigate a  million business payout to chief executive leung chunying on thursday as political fallout grows from massive studentled protests calling for democracy in the chinesecontrolled city the controversy ratchets up the pressure on the probeijing leader just days after tens of thousands of people occupied the streets of the asian financial centre and called for leung to step down the campaign against the former property surveyor and son of a policeman has now extended from the streets to the citys  legislative chambers where democrats have the numbers to veto major decisions and potentially cause policy paralysis australias fairfax media reported this week that engineering firm ugl ltd paid leung a total of  million in  and  in relation to its acquisition of dtz holdings a property consultant that employed leung as its asia pacific director before he took office in july  leungs office denied any wrongdoing dtz was not immediately available to comment while ugl said it was under no obligation to disclose the agreement as part of the contract leung signed with ugl in december  he agreed to promote the ugl group and the dtz group as ugl may reasonably require including but not limited to acting as a referee and adviser from time to time according to a copy seen by reuters leungs office said in a statement that such assistance would only be provided in the event that he failed to be elected hong kong leader and providing that such assistance would not create any conflict of interest leung stepped down from dtz on december   two days after signing the deal with ugl which acquired the property consultancy leung was sworn in as hong kong chief executive in july  after cy leung became ce chief executive he should have terminated the contract because as a ce it was impossible for him to continue accepting huge payment to help promote ugl or dtz democratic party chief executive lam cheukting said in a letter to the independent commission against corruption seen by reuters theres reason to believe that cy leung was eyeing the unpaid remuneration by ugl so that he continued with the agreement even worse since cy leung honoured the agreement and accepted the payment how could he not declare to the executive council said lam who is a former antigraft agency official the icac said it did not comment on individual cases ugl said the agreement was simply a noncompete arrangement to ensure that leung would not move to a competitor set up or promote any business in competition with dtz or poach any people from dtz emily lau head of the democratic party told reuters it would try to form a select committee to investigate and possibly impeach leung although the formation of such a group would have to be backed by the entire seat legislature and there was no guarantee that would happen given the probeijing majority policy backlog scenes of tear gas wafting between some of the worlds most  valuable buildings violent clashes mass disruptions to business and commuter chaos over the past  days have underscored the challenges beijing faces in imposing its will on hong kong the protests triggered by chinas decision in august to rule out direct elections in  have already caused a backlog in the former british colonys legislative council where  scores of meetings have been cancelled democratic lawmakers on thursday threatened to veto some government funding applications although none that affect peoples daily lives as they step up their civil disobedience campaign and try to paralyse government operations on friday student leaders are to hold talks with government officials in a bid to ease tensions there will be a dialogue between government and students this friday student leader alex chow told reporters the government must respond to the publics demand for democracy that can convince the hong kong people that we can see light at end of tunnel regarding democratic development and that we can see changes instead of acting like a human recorder in repeating the bureaucratic content that it had repeated and repeated again protest numbers have dwindled to just a few hundred people at various sites around the city but activists have managed to keep up their blockade of some major roads the report on payments to leung who has refused calls from protesters all week to step down will only pile further pressure on the government and could even lead protesters pulling out of the talks the fairfax media report does not suggest leung committed any crime although it raises questions about transparency leung signed the deal with ugl in december  two days before he stepped down as asia pacific director of dtz which is now a division of ugl he had already announced his plans to run for hong kongs top job although his main rival henry tang was the presumed frontrunner until he was tarnished by an illegal construction scandal and selfconfessed marital infidelities an election committee stacked with beijing loyalists chose leung as leader in march  and he was sworn in on july  leungs company cy leung

S'beijing   chinas legislature on sunday ruled out allowing open nominations in the inaugural election for hong kongs leader saying they would create a chaotic society democracy activists in the asian financial hub responded by saying that a longthreatened mass occupation of the heart of the city will definitely happen in setting tight limits on how far electoral reforms can go in hong kong beijing issued its firmest reminder yet that its still in charge despite the substantial autonomy it promised the city after taking control from britain in  the guidelines laid down by chinas communist leaders ratchet up the potential for a showdown pitting beijing against hong kong democracy supporters a group that represents a broad swath of society including students religious leaders and financial workers the decision by the legislatures powerful standing committee sharpens fears that china wants to screen candidates for loyalty to the central government and is reneging on its promise to let hong kongs leader be directly elected by voters rather than the current committee of mostly probeijing tycoons at this very moment the path of dialogue has been exhausted said benny tai a leader of the occupy central with love and peace protest movement which has vowed to rally at least  people to paralyze hong kongs financial district  known as central  to press demands for genuine democracy the group will launch wave after wave of protest action in the coming weeks until we get to a point when we launch the allout occupy central action tai told reporters university students are also planning to boycott classes next month thousands of people gathered in a park across from hong kong government headquarters sunday evening to protest the widely expected announcement chanting slogans and waving their cellphones earlier in the day li fei deputy secretary general of the national peoples congress standing committee told a news conference in beijing that openly nominating candidates would create a chaotic society under the legislatures guidelines a maximum of three candidates each approved by more than half of a member nominating committee will be put forth to hong kongs  million eligible voters in  the public will have no say in choosing candidates raising fears of what some have termed fake democracy these rights come from laws they dont come from the sky li said many hong kong people have wasted a lot of time discussing things that are not appropriate and arent discussing things that are appropriate making clear that chinese leaders intend to tightly control politics in hong kong li emphasized that candidates for the citys chief executive should be loyal to chinas ruling communist party he has to be responsible to hong kong and to the central government li said if hong kongs chief executive doesnt love the country and love the party then that cant work in one country under the principle of one country two systems hong kong is granted a high degree of control over its own affairs and civil liberties unseen on the mainland occupy central said the plan to block the central financial district was the last resort an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice it said that the occupation of central will definitely happen without specifying a date hong kongs government still needs to hold more consultations on beijings guidelines and then formulate a bill that has to be passed by a twothirds majority in the citys legislature occupy central urged legislators who hold just over a third of seats to vote against it and start the constitutional reform process all over again but the citys current leader leung chunying warned that if the proposal is blocked it would fall to the nomination committee to pick a leader and the city would be deprived of the voting right that they would otherwise be entitled the decision on the nomination committee is very hypocritical said christine chu who joined the prodemocracy rally sunday night this is not true universal suffrage so we cannot accept this result we will do whatever we can to fight for what we want willy lam an expert on chinese politics at the chinese university of hong kong said that the requirement that a candidate is supported by more than half of the nomination committee will rule out candidates from the pandemocratic parties only if its lowered to  percent can a pandemocratic candidate get in as there could be enough political diversity in the committee to back a more democratically minded person lam said beijings announcement comes after a summer of protests and counterprotests that have gripped hong kong including a rally two weeks ago by probeijing activists to denounce occupy central as threatening the citys stability political tensions spiked in june when chinese officials released a policy white paper declaring that hong kongs high degree of autonomy  comes solely from the authorization by the central leadership many read the policy paper as asserting beijings dominance of hong kongs affairs and hit the streets and the internet in protest occupy central drew beijings rebuke by organizing an online referendum to bolster support for full democracy that received nearly  votes also sunday the incumbent leader of the nearby chinesecontrolled casino capital of macau fernando chui was elected to a second fiveyear term by a beijingfriendly committee even though  percent of  votes cast in a similar referendum were in favor of universal suffrage in   chan reported

S'hong kong   in the hong kong protests not all is as it seems from the shadows of the citys mass street protests murky characters have emerged allegations have spread among protesters the local media and online that triad gangsters paid demonstrators police pretending to be protest leaders and even a stuntman feigning suicidal tendencies have arrayed themselves against the students and the occupy central movement part of this is to do with rumors flying around in a continually changing situation with no time for people to verify what they read or hear but with the chinese communist party in the background after taking control from britain in  hong kong citizens are ever ready to believe such claims of duplicity michael degolyer a political economist at hong kong baptist university said there is a wedge of distrust within hong kong society because there is a coyness about who belongs to the communist party  which does not officially exist as a party within the political system here  while another section of society suspects there are foreign interests giving directions within this former colony there are rich grounds for suspicion from both the prodemocracy groups or you might say the proamerican or probritish groups and the progovernment or you might say the probeijing groups that they are not being honest about really who is encouraging them or giving them money or directing them degolyer said this is not a society that is characterized by a huge degree of trust this atmosphere of distrust has come to the fore during days of protests by students and occupy central an alliance of prodemocracy activists who are calling for genuine democratic reforms in this semiautonomous region when police fired tear gas and pepper spray on protesters on sept  it caused an upsurge in support and brought tens of thousands of hong kong residents onto the streets on sunday afternoon a man who wanted the protests to end climbed up to the top of a pedestrian walkway over a key road that has been at their epicenter and looked as if he might jump if student leaders didnt meet with him he used a megaphone to berate protesters for stopping him from getting to work and his three children from going to school and later brandished a box cutter while he was still up there rumors circled on social media and the prodemocracy apple daily reported that he was in fact a stuntman who had been hired to disrupt the protests what purported to be his photo in the stuntmans register was circulated but the hong kong stuntmans association denied on tuesday that the stuntman identified as leung siu hung was the man in question it doesnt look anything like him hes much fitter spokeswoman rita yeung said by phone police and fire crews had rushed to lay out two large inflatable cushions beneath him and some protesters tried to debate with him no leaders came to meet with him and he eventually stepped down nearly five hours later later sunday amid division among protesters after occupy central had announced it was withdrawing from some areas local television broadcasts showed joe yeung identified as a protester shaking hands with a police official and saying protesters would remove barriers from outside the office of the chief executive hong kongs leader later on internet users found out that yeung was an auxiliary police officer and accused him of being part of a ruse yeung told the associated press by phone that he was both a parttime police officer and an occupy central supporter and since sundays incident had handed in his resignation he said he had made up his mind to resign from the police when he saw officers using pepper spray on the students the week before kevin tam a psychologist at the hong kong university of science and technology said peoples trust in the traditional media had faded during the protests because factcheckers on social media had alleged inaccuracies in their reports and there was more information available on social media than in the traditional media including videos this reinforces some preexisting concerns  of the tight control of the government on information and that of course violates the core values of hong kong we are used to have transparency information can flow very freely tam said the concern has been there for a while because of course people understand what happens in mainland china on the mainland authorities can largely control the narrative on any outbreaks of unrest after clashes broke out friday when an angry mob tried to force prodemocracy activists from the streets they were occupying in the mong kok area hong kong police and its security chief were forced to deny that they had any connection to criminal gangs suspected of inciting attacks on peaceful demonstrators online accounts and videos accused the police of standing by while protesters were beaten they cant drive us away with tear gas so they are trying to do it with gangsters said protester johnny hui  summing up a widespread belief among protesters that the hong kong government and police were colluding with triads photos circulated on social media of a call to blue ribbon action  in reference to the blue ribbons some progovernment supporters wear  and a price list for causing a disturbance the maximum payment was hk us the claims could not be independently confirmed and calls to a telephone number

S'hong kong   hong kongs leader is willing to let prodemocracy demonstrations blocking large areas of the city go on for weeks if necessary a source close to him said while defiant protesters vowed they would not budge the citys streets were calm early on thursday while police largely kept their distance from the thousands of mostly young people keeping up protests now nearly a week old in several areas of the global financial hub the protesters want hong kongs leader leung chunying to step down by the end of thursday and have demanded china introduce full democracy so the city can freely choose its own leader leung appointed by beijing has refused to stand down leaving the two sides far apart in a dispute over how much political control china should have over to hong kong the popular occupy central movement presents one of the biggest political challenges for beijing since it violently crushed prodemocracy protests in tiananmen square in  leung hong kongs chief executive is prepared to allow the protests to subside and will only intervene if there is looting or violence said a government source with ties to leung unless theres some chaotic situation we wont send in riot police  we hope this doesnt happen the source said we have to deal with it peacefully even if it lasts weeks or months leung could not be reached for comment riot police used tear gas pepper spray and baton charges last weekend to quell unrest the worst in hong kong since china resumed its rule of the former british colony in  the protests have calmed considerably since then and the numbers on the streets have fallen sharply from the tens of thousands seen at the weekend although an air of tension remains and the demonstrations appear far from over however a crowd of about  protesters had blocked the main road leading to leungs office in the central business district some chanting leung chunying step down us president barack obama told visiting chinese foreign minister wang yi who earlier met secretary of state john kerry that washington was watching the protests closely and urged a peaceful solution the united states has consistently supported the open system that is essential to hong kongs stability and prosperity universal suffrage and the aspiration of the hong kong people the white house said in a statement about the meeting also attended by national security adviser susan rice universal suffrage is an eventual goal under the one country two systems formula by which china rules hong kong under that formula china accords hong kong some autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland china however protesters calling for free elections reacted angrily when beijing decreed on aug  that it would vet candidates wishing to run in hong kongs  election wang said before an earlier meeting with kerry that countries should not meddle in chinas internal affairs the chinese government has very formally and clearly stated its position hong kong affairs are chinas internal affairs all countries should respect chinas sovereignty wang said what else can we do national day a public holiday marking the communist partys foundation of the peoples republic of china in  passed on wednesday without the police crackdown many in hong kong had feared although some people booed while the national anthem was played at a ceremony protesters across the city have dug in setting up supply stations with water bottles fruit disposable raincoats towels goggles face masks and tents even so some in the crowds wondered how long the status quo could last i dont think we can stay like this for more than two weeks said moses ng a yearold who works in sales and marketing gesturing towards young people milling around barricaded streets in causeway bay a major shopping district if so this action would have totally failed so we are thinking about what else we can do others like yearold secondary school pupil wong chi min were more defiant people will keep coming back every day he said we will wait for cy leung to step down so we can choose our own leader if he doesnt we will continue to wait here the hong kong federation of students one of the protest organizers urged people to surround more government buildings from friday unless the authorities accepted their demands but leung has said beijing would not back down and that hong kong police would be able to maintain security without help from peoples liberation army troops from the mainland beijings dilemma china has dismissed the protests as illegal but in a worrying sign for the communist party leadership in beijing the demonstrations have spread to neighboring macau and taiwan china now faces a dilemma cracking down too hard on the movement could shake confidence in marketdriven hong kong which has a separate legal system from the rest of china not reacting firmly enough however could embolden dissidents on the mainland an editorial in the peoples daily the communist partys official organ said the occupy central protests were confrontational and that some protesters wanted to make trouble they will eventually suffer the consequences of their actions it said on wednesday rights groups said a number of chinabased activists supporting the hong kong protests had been detained or intimidated by police on the mainland around  people crowded into taipeis liberty square on wednesday in a show of solidarity with hong kong events are being watched closely in taiwan which has full democracy but is considered by beijing as a renegade province that must one day be reunited with the mainland in the worlds largest gambling hub of macau a former portuguese colony and like hong kong a chinese special administrative region organizers said around  people gathered in friendship square to show their support in london hundreds of protesters gathered outside the chinese embassy some carrying umbrellas that have become the symbol of the hong kong demonstrations about  people also gathered in new yorks times square in support of the protest many holding aloft open umbrellas turmoil in hong kong has begun to affect the economy hong kong radio rthk quoted joseph tung executive director of the citys travel industry council as saying chinas tourism authorities had suspended approval of tourist groups from the mainland to hong kong citing safety issues some banks and other financial firms have begun moving staff to backup premises on the outskirts of hong kong to prevent growing unrest in the financial hub from disrupting trading and other critical functions this

S'hong kong   hong kong protest leaders on friday welcomed an offer by the territorys leader of talks to defuse the crisis over demonstrations seeking democratic reforms though they continued to demand he resign and maintained barricades around government headquarters frustrating staff going to work student protesters had threatened to surround or occupy government buildings if chief executive leung chunying did not step down by midnight thursday and police had warned of serious consequence for the protesters who have grown into the biggest challenge to beijings authority since china took control of the former british colony in  the government said the central government offices would be closed friday after some civil servants and other workers arriving for their shifts following a twoday holiday were unable to get past the barricades it advised workers to follow contingency plans it was unclear what kind of compromise the talks might achieve though they might be part of a strategy to dampen the momentum of the protesters a frontpage editorial friday in the peoples daily newspaper published by chinas ruling communist party underlined the leaderships unwillingness to negotiate changes to its decision that all candidates in an inaugural  election for chief executive be approved by a committee of mostly probeijing elites protesters want open nominations and also have demanded that leung  chosen by such a committee  step down what we want to fight for is our freedom and the free nomination of candidates for our chief executive said ivy chan a yearold social worker she welcomed word of the talks and said she hoped that police would not again use tear gas on protesters as they did last sunday to disperse huge crowds just minutes before thursdays midnight deadline set by protesters leung held a news conference to offer the talks but said i will not resign standing beside leung was the territorys top civil servant chief secretary carrie lam and he asked her to arrange the talks she said she would seek to meet with leaders of the demonstrations as soon as possible i hope both sides will be satisfied she said students had wanted a public meeting but i hope that we can have some flexibility to discuss details the hong kong federation of students said in a statement early friday that they planned to join the talks with the government focused specifically on political reforms they reiterated that leung step down saying he had lost his integrity one of the leaders of the broader occupy central democracy group which started a longthreatened plan to paralyze the citys downtown core by joining the student demonstration also welcomed the talks but insisted that leung quit this could be an opportunity to solve the plight we are facing said benny tai chinas government has been largely silent on the protests other than to call them illegal and support the hong kong governments efforts to disperse them however the peoples daily has published lengthy commentaries on the protests on friday it said a small group of protesters were attempting hijack the system and force changes to the electoral rules to benefit a minority of people the core of their efforts to gain socalled universal suffrage is to ensure that their representatives including those who confront the central government can become candidates for chief executive it said this effort was doomed to failure and that there was no room for concessions on the candidate screening issue it reminded that hong kong is directly under the jurisdiction of the central government it is not a country or an independent political entity when negotiating the handover of hong kong from britain chinas ruling communist leaders agreed to a one country two systems that would preserve westernstyle civil liberties and broad autonomy while promising eventual democracy protesters say china is reneging on a promise that the citys top leader will be chosen through universal suffrage leung said the authorities would continue to tolerate the protests as long as participants did not charge police lines but urged them to stop their occupation of much of the downtown area i urge students not to charge into or occupy government buildings  its not about my personal inconvenience he said these few days the protesters occupation of key areas of the city has already seriously affected hong kongs economy peoples daily lives and government functioning before leung spoke the heads of two major universities whose students joined in launching the protests appeared before a jittery crowd in front of the entrance to his office and appealed for calm earlier thursday police were seen bringing in supplies of tear gas and other riot gear and the protesters prepared face masks and goggles as tensions rose in the standoff outside the imposing government compound near the waterfront after leungs news conference however the atmosphere was palpably calmer although many protesters expressed disappointment about the proposed talks  associated press writers louise watt wendy tang joanna chiu and elaine kurtenbach contributed to this report'

S'hong kong   in the heart of mong kok one of the most densely populated districts on earth an abandoned hong kong police van is enveloped in the studentled demonstrations paralyzing swathes of the city along with yellow ribbons and flowers symbols of the citys prodemocracy movement protesters have taped a handwritten placard in chinese and english to the side of the locked and undamaged vehicle we cant accept the hong kong police becoming the gong an it reads  a reference to chinas feared public security bureau which enjoys virtually unfettered powers on the mainland the stranded police vehicle and the protesters warning encapsulate the dilemma that the mass protests pose for chinas rulers and the authorities in hong kong they need to contain the campaign for democracy in one of asias leading financial hubs without the tools employed on the mainland to suppress dissent including sweeping powers of arrest indefinite detention compliant courts and a controlled media while peoples liberation army forces are stationed in hong kong they have remained in their barracks they will only be deployed on the streets if rioting and looting break out and the local police are unable to contain the violence said two people with ties to the central government leadership the mobilization of pla troops in hong kong is a last resort and only if things got totally out of control one of the people said as tens of thousands of protesters gather for a sixth day their demand for the right to choose their leaders in fully democratic elections poses the biggest popular challenge to the ruling communist party since chinese president xi jinping took power two years ago the umbrella revolution so called for the protesters use of umbrellas to shield against pepper spray comes at an inopportune time for xi he is trying to steer a slowing economy while moving against powerful vested interests in one of the most wideranging purges and anticorruption campaigns since the communists came to power in  it is a frontal challenge to their authority regina ip a lawmaker and a top advisor to hong kongs embattled political leader chief executive leung chunying says of the protests people have to understand how beijing sees this china feels threatened ip told reuters skinny yearold at the forefront of this challenge is student leader joshua wong chifung a skinny yearold with a mop of straight black hair framing his angular face last friday after a weeklong student boycott of classes wong was demonstrating with hundreds of secondary school students outside the hong kong governments harborfront offices it was  pm and some of the students were beginning to drift off when wong picked up the microphone please everybody dont go just yet he pleaded in his crisp staccato cantonese through the shrill feedback of the speaker please give me some face and listen before leaving he joked ok the students yelled back as wong spoke fellow student leaders alex chow and lester shum followed by their colleagues suddenly rushed the threemeter fence and gate protecting the government offices shouting charge charge police arrested wong immediately and took chow and shum into custody the next day but legal limits on the power of the authorities soon frustrated their efforts to take the student leaders out of circulation in the high court on sunday evening justice patrick li honleung ordered wongs immediate release granting a writ of habeas corpus one of the britishimplemented protections that hong kong inherited from its former colonial master wong would have no such protection on the mainland where an equivalent right doesnt exist and where protest leaders are often beaten and routinely detained for long periods without trial wongs lawyer michael vidler says justice li told the court that events might have taken a different course if wong had not been detained for so long in the two days wong and his fellow student leaders were held without charge tens of thousands of protesters had converged on the government offices and three other hong kong districts about an hour before justice li ordered wongs release riot police had fired volleys of tear gas in a bid to break up the demonstrations the first time in decades that this riot control measure had been used against hong kong protesters flanked by his lawyers wong pushed his right hand forward waisthigh and flashed a defiant thumbs up as he walked free his detention had provided the spark that galvanized the citys prodemocracy movement and kickstarted occupy central a longmooted plan to lock down the commercial heart of chinas most important financial center dont repeat june  while leaders in hong kong consult with beijing on how best to clear the streets the studentdominated protests will be an unnerving reminder for xi and other top party leaders of the tiananmen square demonstrations  years ago in june  that isnt lost on the students on sogo corner in causeway bay hong kongs neonlit equivalent of new yorks times square protesters have put up posters that carry the words dont repeat june  already an image from the hong kong protests that draws a parallel with the iconic tank man photograph from the tiananmen demonstrations has gone viral on social media the image is drawn from a photograph of a protester holding two umbrellas aloft as he is enveloped in a cloud of tear gas the greatest fear for chinas leaders is that unrest could spread from hong kong to the mainland while chinese online censors have barred most discussion of the protests during the first few days they failed to block searches for the chinese expression for umbrella revolution by wednesday they had caught up and the term had also been barred for its part the staterun media mostly limited its coverage of events in hong kong to official condemnations of the protests but there are signs that news of the demonstrations has penetrated the mainland firewall chinese human rights defenders a coalition of mainland and international human rights groups said on wednesday that dozens of mainland activists had been detained or intimidated for expressing support for hong kongs protests reuters could not immediately confirm the detentions in macau the gambling hub that neighbors hong kong and where the mainland exerts more influence several hundred protesters gathered in a central square wednesday evening in support of the protests hong kong has an independent judiciary and its citizens enjoy wideranging liberties including freedom of speech and assembly which is denied on the mainland no easy choices there are no easy choices for xi or leung chinas handpicked man in hong kong if they order a harsh crackdown it could destroy hong kongs reputation as a stable financial center jeopardize investment in china and spark capital outflows from the mainland at a time when the chinese economy is slowing markedly china is aiming for economic growth of about  per cent this year but a run of underwhelming data including sagging industrial output and falling property prices  suggests expansion may fall short of that target a heavyhanded response could also fatally underminethe one country two systems formula by which hong kong has been ruled since the  handover and which chinas leaders have hoped would one day be extended to taiwan already there have been protests in taipei in solidarity with the hong kong students one country two systems has also been touted for taiwan says ken kuo a taiwan exchange student living in hong kong he  joined the protests in the admiralty district where crowds have been largest but as you can see todays hong kong will be tomorrows taiwan if it is adopted there is also no guarantee that greater force will end the protests so far the use of pepper spray and tear gas has only emboldened protesters it has also won them greater sympathy from residents of the city who view these police tactics as excessive trucks from sympathetic businesses have delivered food and bottled water to the protest areas the demonstrators have also adopted tactics that make it difficult for the authorities to crack down despite the humidity thunderstorms crowding and limited facilities in hong kong this week the crowds have been highly disciplined avoiding violence and confrontation since after the early attempt by the small group of students to force their way into government headquarters tidy rebels teams of volunteers pick up rubbish and litter even sorting it for recycling supplies of food and water are organized in neat stockpiles along the edges of the main traffic arteries in the center of hong kong and the demonstrators who are blocking key roads obediently part for ambulances and emergency vehicles protest leaders constantly remind the crowds that they must be peaceful and orderly on wednesday morning when a small group of antioccupy central protesters arrived in admiralty district prodemocracy demonstrators linked hands protectively around them to ensure there was no chance of a clash after the use of tear gas and pepper spray only succeeded in stoking the demonstrations police beat a tactical retreat distancing themselves from the main centers of protest the hope is that the demonstrators will tire and melt away said a senior police officer in hong kong in what appears to be part of this plan promainland groups that routinely mount noisy counterdemonstrations to prodemocracy marches have been largely unseen on the streets but if the standoff worsens and xi is seen to be unsuccessful in ending the protests that could work against him says cheng li a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington xi and his supporters have launched a sweeping corruption crackdown across the mainland partly designed to take down a dangerous rival retired senior leader zhou yongkang who used to head chinas pervasive security apparatus the ongoing purge of zhou and his sprawling network of relatives political allies and business supporters has convulsed leadership politics in beijing a misstep from xi that leads to ongoing instability in hong kong could provide ammunition for his rivals fissures in beijing for now chinas leaders are united in their attitude toward hong kong said li if the confrontation escalates xi could become vulnerable to attack from other leaders who might be unhappy over his corruption crackdown or economic policies he said they are on the same page largely li said of the leadershipbut if some dramatic events start to happen they might start to have a different view xi will not back down on chinas decision that only a handful of beijingvetted candidates can stand for the next elections for hong kongs chief executive in  says lawmaker regina ip in their eyes the hong kong chief executive is more powerful than a provincial chinese leader says ip who held talks in beijing last month with zhang dejiang chinas thirdranked leader and the top official responsible for hong kong from their perspective it is unthinkable that a future leader of hong kong is not patriotic or that hong kong was allowed to become a base for subversion one chinabased western diplomat likened the showdown in hong kong to a game of chicken two cars speed toward one another the diplomat said beijings strategy is to throw away the steering wheel so the other party has to swerve away first its like that with full democracy prodemocracy forces are also standing firm even if the protests unwind the hong kong and mainland authorities will still face the fundamental question posed by the demonstrators why cant educated moderate and lawabiding chinese people choose their own leaders as the swelling protests indicate xi has yet to provide an answer that would satisfy protesters in hong kong or for that matter taiwans voters who have grown accustomed to changing their government at the ballot box much of the pressure now falls on leung he must find a way to end the protests that will satisfy beijing without completely alienating the residents of hong kong hands off the leadership in beijing appears to have shifted the onus to him the central government did not pressure hong kong to disperse the protesters said another source with ties to the leadership in beijing the hong kong government was proactive because it did not want to be perceived by the central government to be weak a person close to leung who spoke on condition of anonymity said beijing was being very hands off in what he described as a critical moment for the current administration in hong kong he also said that leung has never considered acceding to the protesters demand that he resign in his national day speech on wednesday leung seemed to suggest that giving all the citys five million eligible voters the right to cast a ballot for candidates that were vetted by beijing was better than no elections at all it is understandable that different people may have different ideas about a desirable reform package he said but it is definitely better to have universal suffrage than not leung will also be wary of the power of hong kong protesters when they take to the streets in big numbers a strong protest on july   stunned the hong kong government and eventually forced beijings handpicked leader tung cheehwa to step down it marked the first time since the founding of the peoples republic of china that the communist party was forced to back down in the face of popular pressure and jettison a senior leader leung and tung now an advisor to the mainland government stood sidebyside in hong kong at the national day flagraising ceremony which marks the anniversary of the founding of the peoples republic on october   the protest leaders didnt disrupt the event but as leung his top officials and dignitaries watched the raising of the chinese national flag shouts and chants could be clearly heard from the protesters in admiralty district a block behind them in an embarrassment to leung the protesters did force the hong kong authorities to cancel the traditional fireworks display a centerpiece of the national day celebrations that normally draws a huge crowd to the harbor front and he had to travel by boat to the ceremony because the roads were blocked by the protests additional reporting by benjamin kang lim charlie zhu donny
