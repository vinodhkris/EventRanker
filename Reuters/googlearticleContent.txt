S'our recent analysis of economic inequality and web searches generated a lot of discussion and hundreds of online comments two of the google researchers who helped with the analysis  hal varian the companys chief economist and seth stephensdavidowitz  offered to answer reader comments at my request they focused particularly on comments that questioned the methodology or results as the article explained this analysis was not uncovering the most popular search terms in each place it was pointing to the search terms that were relatively popular in some places  and decidedly rare in others we encourage readers to do their own analyses too and let us know what you find the links at the bottom of this post may be helpful mr stephensdavidowitz is also a contributing opinion writer for the times and you can read more of his work here the answers below come from both researchers q it would be interesting to know the source for the technology in the hardest places to live are they accessing it at their local libraries or do they own the technology this comparison is only good since you are comparing the people in each part who can access the internet in the hardest part there may be many who cant while in the easier parts probably the majority can  terri l rochester ny a we have no idea how people are accessing the internet it could be from home work school libraries coffeehouses etc the pew research center estimated last year that  percent of americans used the internet which means that even most lowincome households now do q obscure individual canon camera models cannot make up half the searches in the soft states   laura j philadelphia a google correlate does not return the most common searches overall such as searches for weather it returns searches that are more common in hard states than easy states note that these calculations are based on  years of queries during the period from  digital cameras were a musthave gadget for affluent households not surprisingly people from affluent areas searched more for these items online if the data were restricted to  the musthave gadgets would be different q i find it curious that porn was not mentioned in this article as the common denominator search for all income levels except for the very poor who cant afford internet its been documented for years that porn is one of the major economic engines of the internet and accounts for most of the daily internet searches  alex vermont a adult terms are not included in google correlate which is meant to be a familyfriendly tool even if they were we doubt that there would be big differences across regions q you took out the searches that were popular in both but didnt tell us how extensive the overlap was if you removed  of the searches and these are just the very few that differed then this tells us next to nothing if the overlap was tiny then what remained after removing it might be meaningful   scott l a think about it this way new york and los angeles have similar search patterns they make many searches for facebook and youtube and weather and breaking bad and justin bieber but los angeles googles for the lakers far more than new york does and new york googles for the knicks far more than los angeles does this is a meaningful difference q ive never heard of almost everything in the easy column and yet i supposedly live such a life could the easy column be skewed by the geekynerd technogadgety folks on either coast silicon valley and silicon alley after all they spend even longer periods on the internet than even the most devoted  office worker   daisy sue new york a the results do not mean that everybody in easy places searches for the easyplaces searches and everybody in hard places searches for the hardplaces searches instead the results just mean that the searches are far more common in easy places than hard places or vice versa q even if one were simply mining the data for differences in technology searches one would expect a lot more queries about apple and samsung products among the easy place people than canon products in these days of smartphones i know more people who own a fitbit than a canon powershot and vengaboys at the  spot really  nfnmg a see our answers above for an explanation of correlation you can upload statelevel data to google correlate and find the queries that are most correlated with that data over the year period  examples here are the searches most correlated with support for obama and here are searches most correlated with support for romney here are searches most correlated with the size of the evangelical population and here are searches most correlated with the size of the jewish population feel free to enter your own data and tell us what you find'

VMelding Two Flickr Accounts Into One

S'q is it possible to combine two separate flickr accounts into one a yahoos help guide for flickr states that its not currently possible to merge two or more flickr accounts under one login id the page also suggests that you download the photos from one flickr account and upload them into the other to get all the photos in one place if you want to merge the photos into one account to create a new flickr identity because of a new business marriage or other joint venture you can also just change the screen name on the account you plan to keep using  or download all the pictures from both of the old accounts and upload them into a brandnew flickr account first though you have to download the photos from the account you do not want to use anymore to download a picture click in its thumbnail in your flickr photostream and then click the download icon in the bottomright corner of the window from the menu that opens select the size you want to download if you have hundreds of photos on flickr downloading them one by one gets tedious although flickr itself does not offer any bulkdownload tools thirdparty programs like downloadair or bulkr can grab multiple images at once once you have all the photos downloaded you can upload them back to whichever account will be your main flickr identity the site has its own webpage to upload pictures by dragging and dropping them in the browser window but you can find thirdparty tools like picbackmans flickr uploader for windows and mac os x or fstop mac os x to make bulk uploads easier as well using the ok google command on the computer q i read that you can say ok google now to start a voice search with the chrome browser but when i talk to my pc nothing happens what am i doing wrong a google increased the existing voice search capabilities to the desktop version of chrome last spring and now offers the handsfree ok google command when you have a new tab page open at wwwgooglecom to use it make sure you have updated your software to the latest version of the chrome browser and then visit the chrome settings to turn on the ok google feature you should also check that your computers microphone is working properly to turn on ok google click the chrome menu button on the farright side of the browser window and select settings on the settings page click the show advanced settings link and scroll down to the privacy section turn on the option that enables ok google to start a voice search the setting is in the privacy section because an audio recording of what you say is sent up to google when you go to the google home page look for a tiny microphone icon in the search box if it is working correctly you should see a black microphone icon and listening for ok google displayed say the magic words before you ask your search question and see what google brings back the feature currently works in english both american and british french german and russian and on those corresponding international versions of googles site'

S'san francisco   facebook built itself into the no  digital advertising platform in the world by analyzing the vast amount of data it had on each of its  billion users to sell individually targeted ads on its social network now it is going to take those targeted ads to the rest of the internet mounting its most direct challenge yet to google the leader in digital advertising with nearly onethird of the global market on monday facebook will roll out a rebuilt ad platform called atlas that will allow marketers to tap its detailed knowledge of its users to direct ads to those people on thousands of other websites and mobile apps we are bringing all of the peoplebased marketing functions that marketers are used to doing on facebook and allowing them to do that across the web david jakubowski the companys head of advertising technology said in an interview for example if pepsico one of the first advertisers to sign on to the service wanted to reach college age men with ads for its mountain dew baja blast it could use atlas to identify several million of those potential customers and show each of them a dozen ads for the soft drink on game apps sports and video sites atlas would also provide pepsi with information to help it assess which ads were the most effective if successful such crossplatform advertising could create a new revenue stream for facebook and offer marketers an attractive alternative to ad networks run by google yahoo apple and others facebook has deep deep data on its users you can slice and dice markets like women  to  who live in the southeast and are fans of breaking bad said rebecca lieb a digital advertising and media analyst at the altimeter group a research firm the new atlas platform she said can track people across devices weave together online and offline but such detailed tracking of facebook users on and off the service also raises privacy concerns in june the company warned that it was doing extended tracking for advertising purposes and announced a new tool that allows individuals to see and change some of the information that facebook has collected on them there is a big brother perception that is a side effect of this kind of precision targeting ms lieb said people are worried that you know them she said consumer concerns about privacy are helping to drive interest in alternative social networks such as the startup ello that are promising not to use customer information for advertising facebook says it never discloses the identity of individuals to marketers and that any matching of say pepsis own database of its fans to facebooks data is done on a blind basis many other internet companies from google and yahoo to littleknown data brokers collect data on individuals based on their web browsing and other activities and use it to target ads but facebooks combination of real identity and voluntarily disclosed personal information makes it a particularly valuable tool for marketers the facebook login is most useful on mobile devices where traditional web tracking tools like cookies and pixel tags do not work if a person is logged into the facebook app on a smartphone the company has the ability to see what other apps he or she is using and could show ads within those apps nobody else besides facebook has the depth of data about individuals said debra aho williamson a principal analyst at the research firm emarketer thats where the power of this ad platform is going to come from the omnicom group one of the largest advertising companies in the world will be the first to sign up to use atlas mobile has been a very hard thing for us to do said jonathan nelson chief executive of omnicom digital this atlas solution is a huge step forward in making mobile marketing more effective atlas has its roots in a company of the same name that facebook bought from microsoft last year and facebook has signaled for months that it would use the acquisition as the basis for a broader ad offering the revamped atlas platform positions facebook to compete more directly with google which scans user information from sources like email and web searches to help marketers target ads across the internet and increasingly mobile devices facebook has a strong track record of delivering results for advertisers on its social network but now the company must prove it can do the same on other sites a lot of these digital media companies are working on different ways to go after the same people ms williamson said were going to see facebook being a very strong competitor but if i were an advertiser i would look at all of them'

VOpposition Grows in Europe to Google Antitrust Proposal
p175
sg6
S'brussels  microsoft and the german publishing industry on thursday stepped up pressure on the european unions antitrust chief to make radical adjustments to a proposed antitrust settlement with google or effectively leave resolution of the case to his successor at a news conference in brussels a senior lawyer for microsoft said the company had gathered new evidence to show that the settlement with google proposed by joaqun almunia the antitrust chief would be ineffective at restoring competition the current proposal does not put traffic diversion to an end jeanyves art the top antitrust lawyer for microsoft in europe said at the news conference microsoft which has long faced antitrust problems of its own in europe has up to now kept a relatively low profile in the case against google the core of the deal between google and mr almunia announced in february is a system that would more prominently display rivals search services  for finding hotels and shopping among others  when people conduct google searches rival companies have lambasted the proposal saying it would do little to help them compete more effectively in europe where google powers more than  percent of searches in many countries in a study conducted over the course of nearly three weeks in april microsoft engineers modified the publicly available search page of its own search site bing to operate like a google search page under the terms of the proposed european settlement in monitoring the way that bing users conducted searches for hotels and restaurants microsoft said it found that people would mostly ignore the parts of the modified page supposedly dedicated to competitors instead microsoft found that users were  times more likely to click on the area of the page that google would dedicate to its own services microsoft submitted the results of the experiment involving three million search queries to mr almunia in july in a news conference one day earlier mr almunia said he had been studying  responses by organizations and companies  including microsoft  to his proposals for a settlement the calls on mr almunia to delay or scrap parts of the settlement have been growing louder in europe where google and other american technology giants are increasingly seen as overweening and intrusive because of their market power and privacy policies google is seeking to avoid a finding of wrongdoing that would bruise its public image and hamper its ability to do business in europe and that could come with a maximum fine of  billion although penalties for antitrust offenses in europe have never gone that high weve cooperated fully with the european commissions investigation over the last four years al verney a spokesman for google said in a statement by email our proposal addresses all of the ecs concerns and greatly increases the visibility of rival services mr art the microsoft lawyer said that his company also remained dissatisfied with other aspects of the proposed settlement especially with terms aimed at helping advertisers use platforms other than google google still was blocking functions that advertisers need to port or manage their advertising campaigns easily and smoothly across platforms including the platform offered to advertisers by microsoft said mr art those restrictions should be eliminated under any settlement with google he said a group of powerful german publishers also made their dissatisfaction with the settlement plain on thursday at the news conference a study conducted on their behalf showed online users were at least twice as likely to click on googles own shopping services than on the alternative google has offered under the proposed settlement said thomas hppner a lawyer for the industry groups bundesverband deutscher zeitungsverleger which represents newspapers and verband deutscher zeitschriftenverleger which represents magazines that study was conducted in july by computer scientists at hamburg university and involved  internet users who were asked in online surveys where they would click on a page served by google when they wanted to buy items like expensive cameras google shopping gathered  percent of all clicks while the area of the page set aside for three rival search services received  percent of all clicks according to the study in other words the proposed design secured google shopping more than three times more clicks than all rivals put together mr hppner said this study was given to mr almunia in august a representative of an industry group representing online travel companies and a founder of the british comparison shopping site foundem were among others to speak at the news conference mr almunia is scheduled to leave office in november after a fiveyear term that has been dominated by his attempts to reach an amicable arrangement with google but amid growing dissatisfaction with google across europe the next commissioner who has yet to be chosen will almost certainly be less patient with the online search giant the decision on mr almunias successor is expected to be made next week by jeanclaude juncker the former prime minister of luxembourg who is scheduled to take over from jos manuel barroso as the next president of the european commission in november one possible nominee is pierre moscovici a former finance minister of france which is one of the countries most skeptical about the way google operates its privacy policies and runs its online search and advertising businesses natasha bertaud a spokeswoman for mr juncker said on thursday that he had not yet made a decision on who should get the job which is among the most powerful in europe'

S'readers respond to a july  letter from marc rotenberg an internet privacy expert calling on policy makers to examine the business practices of dominant internet companies like facebook and google   to the editor your recent article about the reluctance of consumers to turn away from the internet titans suggests that most users are largely satisfied with the current choices principles are no match for europes love of us web titans business day july  a better reading could be that they have no real choices a small group of companies today controls much of the online world internet companies have grown in part because of the same network effects  the benefits that arise with many participants in the same communications environment  that enabled the growth of the internet large internet companies have also benefited from powerful economic incentives a lax regulatory environment rapid technological changes and business practices that are designed to deprive users of meaningful choices the practical consequence is increasing consolidation of internetbased services and little real choice for consumers consider facebooks recent acquisition of whatsapp the popular messaging service or googles purchase of nest the smart home thermostat company both of the target companies had offered strong privacy safeguards to consumers now they  and the data of their users  will simply be subsumed in the larger companies companies are also doing more through the political realm to extend their power witness googles proxy war against the recent privacy decision of the top court in europe waged through media organizations that are themselves losing readers and revenue to google or consider facebooks decision to remove facebook groups critical of the company much is said about the use of these platforms to promote democracy and human rights in the middle east china and russia but hardly a word is spoken when these companies prevent their own users from expressing criticism political institutions today are not well equipped to deal with the realities of the modern internet economy change is happening quickly the benefits are oftentimes dazzling and to many policy leaders disorienting but there is a real need for a more thoughtful critical examination of current business practices marc rotenberg washington july     the writer is president of the electronic privacy information center and has been active in internet governance issues for more than  years readers react there is no one more committed or passionate about online issues than marc rotenberg but i dont share his pessimism about the future of the internet the barriers to entry for new and better online companies are low and consumers are fickle by the millions consumers vote online for their preferred company with the click of a mouse the socalled behemoths now are competing on privacy in a few short years we have seen literally millions of new apps offering new services to consumers  many privacyenhancing and most exciting is the emergence of new tools that promise great features and more user control at startups and behemoths alike watchdogs like mr rotenberg are keeping the pressure on and thats a good thing they should take heart that there is a hopeful future for privacy and the internet christopher wolf washington july     the writer is the founder and cochairman of the future of privacy forum and a lawyer focusing on privacy issues one reason companies such as google may not be facing as much political resistance here as they are in europe is that they have gotten heavily engaged in the political process on both the state and federal levels and on both sides of the aisle since  google has spent an average of  million per month on federal lobbying  ranking third in lobbying spending among all companies according to opensecrets ironically the company that is making the worlds information more accessible is secretive about its own political practices google should join tech peers such as microsoft in disclosing more about its lobbying campaigns and its funding of politically active nonprofits as some shareholders urged at the companys annual meeting sam jewler washington july     the writer is communications officer at us chamber watch a project of public citizen consumers have repeatedly patronized companies knocked for controversial business practices post a comment to your facebook wall about walmart starbucks foxconn microsoft monsanto or any other newsmaker to glimpse these criticisms for the sake of low prices and convenience weve condoned business practices that go against our principles and harm others and occasionally ourselves and now for the sake of low prices free services and convenience provided by internet titans were doing the same thing is it time yet to reassess our priorities jonathan carey san francisco july   mr rotenbergs assessment that our political institutions are not well equipped to deal with internet realities is correct we are at a key regulatory moment now is the moment to educate our policy makers we have a chance for a farseeing policy that puts longterm public need ahead of shortterm private profit to aim only for the bottom line is to aim too low william f baker new york july     the writer is director of the bernard l schwartz center for media public policy and education at fordham university and president emeritus of wnet public television mr rotenbergs letter delivers a welcome breath of clarity and fresh air but it does not go far enough the behemoths that we have to cope with in the united states include the broadband oligopoly of comcast verizon and att the most dangerous scenario is one in which the web giants such as google facebook and netflix collude with the big broadband operators in order to strike deals for the delivery of their services over these operators networks that are beneficial to them as netflix has already done while unreasonably discriminating against smaller internet companies with no or little negotiating power and further increasing consumers costs in other words todays winners will pull up the ladder to inhibit the next wave of innovative entrepreneurs martyn roetter boston july     the writer is a telecommunications consultant facebook recently experimented with its users by modifying their news feeds and concluded that manipulation of the news feed modified the mood of the user facebook seems to consider that it has ownership of its users data and no obligations that arent voluntary the internet itself should be regulated as a public utility we need a national conversation on the rights of users and how to promote competition rather than looking away as the big companies eat up all the potential innovators that might provide competition since so many of the privacy problems are driven by the need for advertising revenue it would be nice to have more forpay players with no ads brigitte de saint phalle albuquerque july   mr rotenbergs observation that network effects allow large internet companies like google facebook and netflix to dominate their markets has implications far beyond the privacy issues he cites the net neutrality debate raging in the united states proceeds from the assumption that internet providers  cable fiber wireless and modern dsl  are monopolies that can bully hapless contentproviding companies but these companies have far greater market power google controls  percent of the market for search and facebook and youtube together control more than  percent of all social media for example from facebook to kickstarter these services are so powerful and popular that no isp could market a network without unimpeded access to them all a provider that discriminated against netflix or ebay in favor of its own offerings would lose customers by the droves google started in a garage but now has a market value about seven times that of general motors the power of the internet companies that mr rotenberg identifies makes clear they dont need regulatory help ev ehrlich bethesda md july     the writer is president of esc company an economics consulting firm and former under secretary of commerce in the clinton administration the writer responds i once would have agreed with mr wolfs view but the evidence increasingly points in a different direction instead of innovators displacing incumbents today incumbents are acquiring innovators federal agencies that once pursued major cases to protect consumer privacy have since dropped the ball on enforcement little has been done to stop the downward spiral of privacy policies and the increasing profiling of internet users mr jewler points to a deeper problem that should trouble many  the institutions of government and the media itself are being transformed by the companies that should be the focus of public scrutiny the united states has a long history of reining in the excesses of private power but that requires effective government and an independent media both are increasingly within the gravitational pull of the large internet companies of course i agree with mr baker about the need for longterm policies that promote growth and innovation while safeguarding privacy and consumer rights that is the direction we need to head but the clock is ticking consolidation is accelerating the titans are already taking steps to block competition in markets that do not yet exist google is trying to buy many of the new internet toplevel domains  books movies family love and earth facebook as ms de saint phalle noted is now manipulating the news users see to make them happy and sad my letter only scratched the surface of the growing threats to the open internet marc

VCourt Rejects Deal on Hiring in Silicon Valley
p283
sg6
S'san francisco   there is ample evidence that silicon valley was engaged in an overarching conspiracy against its own employees a federal judge said on friday and it should either pay dearly or have its secrets exposed at trial judge lucy h koh of the united states district court in san jose rejected as insufficient a proposed  million settlement in a classaction antitrust case that accused leading tech companies of agreeing not to poach one anothers engineers in addition her decision immediately resuscitated a public relations nightmare for google apple and other top tech companies while vindicating a range of observers  including one of the plaintiffs in the suit  who said silicon valley was escaping justice with the case once again heading to trial it threatens to expose to further scrutiny the business practices of steve jobs of apple the blunt emails of mr jobs an unquestioned genius could prove to be his companys undoing the antipoaching agreements at issue in the case stem from the s but the plaintiffs say the practice became widespread in the middle of the last decade when google was expanding and the demand for engineers was greater than ever in april lawyers for the  class members and the companies reached a tentative deal but the judge said the money did not fall within the range of reasonableness after the plaintiffs lawyers took their  percent cut the settlement would have given about  to every member of the class judge koh said that she believed the case was stronger than that and that the plaintiffs lawyers were taking the easy way out by settling the evidence against the defendants was compelling she said and she labeled mr jobs revered in the modern history of technology as a if not the central figure in the alleged conspiracy the case will now go to trial unless the parties cobble together another settlement that meets the judges approval lawyers for the plaintiffs earlier cited damages of  billion to the class members if a jury awarded that amount it would be automatically tripled while judges often finetune proposed classaction settlements it is unusual for one to be entirely thrown out in favor of a trial i cannot recall a judge saying in a classaction case that the amount of settlement is too low and you need to go back and go for broke at trial said daniel crane who teaches antitrust law at the university of michigan law school this is very striking the rejection of the settlement is a victory for one of the five original plaintiffs michael devine who had raised objections to the deal i am pleased that this case again has the opportunity to achieve real justice for the members of the class mr devine said in an interview my hope is that the companies will pay at least as much back to their employees as they gained from these illegal agreements only then will there be real incentive to them and others to respect the law three of the defendants  google apple and adobe  declined to comment a spokesman for the fourth company intel said we are disappointed that the court has rejected preliminary approval of an agreement that was negotiated at arms length over many months settlements were reached last year against three other defendants in the suit  lucasfilm pixar and intuit joseph r saveri a lawyer for the plaintiffs said he could not comment because he was traveling and had not had a chance to review the order another plaintiffs lawyer dean harvey of the firm lieff cabraser heimann  bernstein did not respond to a message requesting comment the case which has been underway for three years has mesmerized silicon valley every time a new piece of evidence comes out people get more shocked than they did the last time said sam altman president of y combinator a technology accelerator that has funded hundreds of startups you dont need a law degree to know that what the companies were doing was deeply wrong judge kohs rejection of the settlement did not come out of the blue at a hearing in late june she sharply questioned the lawyers about the size of their cut and whether they were undervaluing their case she noted the abundance of incriminating material from mr jobs and other executives for instance court papers showed google wanted in  to hire a group of apple engineers mr jobss response if you hire a single one of these people that means war a jury judge koh noted would have found these documents very significant and pretty compelling in the world depicted in the court papers the valley executives feared mr jobs who died in  and did their best to placate him even at the expense of their own businesses for instance sergey brin googles cofounder was quoted as testifying that mr jobss view seemed to be that people shouldnt upset him things that appeared to upset him mr brin said would be hiring you know  whatever and eric schmidt then googles chief executive said steve was unhappy and steves unhappiness absolutely influenced the change we made in recruiting practice at one point mr jobs got a google recruiter terminated for attempting to hire from apple appointed to the federal court in  judge koh is the first asianamerican district judge in the northern district of california before becoming a federal judge she was a judge for the superior court of california for santa clara county she also worked inwashington for the senate judiciary committee and later for the justice department she has overseen many of the most prominent techrelated cases including the big patent fights between apple and samsung electronics she has built a reputation for keeping strict control of her courtroom showing no hesitation to challenge even the most powerful lawyers when she feels they are involved in shenanigans  if the companies wish to forestall a trial they will have to come up with enough to satisfy the judge that justice is being done a settlement that is more in the billiondollar ballpark would likely be viewed by the court as within the zone of reasonableness said orly lobel a professor of employment and labor law at the university of san diego such a figure would be closer to onethird of the potential win in trial'

S'q there are so many platforms for blogging out there can you suggest a few a start your search by thinking about the type of blog you want to have and how much control you want to have over the look and domain name free blogging services usually have a set of standard templates and easy controls to get started but the design is usually not terribly flexible paid services often offer more design control feature management and tools to block spam and other unwanted messages in the comments section if you are an artist or a photographer and want to quickly post about the things you see a visually oriented platform like tumblr may work best tumblr is free and has its own mobile apps for blogging on the go if you want to compose long and thoughtful essays a blogging platform suited to longer writing and editing like medium may be most useful while medium has a mobile app for ios it is currently intended for reading material on the site rather than writing some platforms like typepad and wordpress are flexible enough to handle either approach wordpress comes in two versions one is the free wordpresscom site which provides less customization but hosts the blog on its own servers and has its own mobile apps the other version is found at wordpressorg where the wordpress blogging software and apps for android blackberry and ios can be downloaded and used on someone elses servers you have more control over the look and feel of the blog there if you do not have your own server the site has suggestions for hosting services where the blog will live  on your server or someone elses  is another consideration as is whether you want to use a free or paid platform some free services like googles blogger make it easy to set up a basic blog especially if you already use some of the companys other products like google plus photos paid services like squarespace may cost  a month or more but you get technical support along with perks like searchengine optimization and slick designs that work for both desktop and mobile readers saving a soggy laptop q if a laptops screen is dark and the computer wont boot up properly after a spill is it still possible to save the data on the machine a saving the data is possible but it depends on the nature of the liquid and the damage even if the laptops motherboard is fried it is possible that the liquid did not damage the hard drive if this is the case the drive can be removed and placed in an enclosure or a new computer so the data on it can be retrieved a good authorized repair shop can properly evaluate your situation and with any luck save your data it can also recommend a backup drive if you cannot afford professional help the ifixit doityourself site has a discussion forum on liquid spills at bitlytavren as well as searchable information about using harddrive enclosures wikihow has its own steps for trying to save a laptop immediately after a spill at bitlyifjkab tip of the week the messages app in ios displays texts sent through sms and apples imessage service but the chat history shows the time only at the beginning of a particular conversation to see a list of sent or received time stamps next to the individual messages within a conversation swipe a finger to the left on the screen'

VGoogle Unveils Ambitious Android Expansion at I/O Conference

S'san francisco   google wants to be everywhere in your home your car and even on your wrist that vision became increasingly clear at the search giants annual conference for software developers here on wednesday the company unveiled plans to expand android its mobile operating system for new categories like wearable computers and automobiles the announcements came on the heels of the companys recent acquisition of nest labs the thermostat maker for  billion which gave google a speedy entry into the nascent market of internetconnected home appliances this is one of the most comprehensive releases we have done said sundar pichai chief of googles android division in front of a convention center crowded with  software developers googles annual software developers conference called google io has become an important place for the company to woo app makers to build software for its android software system which powers more than one billion devices rallying app developers is increasingly vital for google as competition grows with rivals like apple and samsung electronics which are also expanding their device and software portfolios whats striking is the way each of these three major companies  google microsoft and apple  are seeking to participate across four key domains the home the car the body and the mobile world at large said jan dawson an independent telecom analyst for jackdaw research google said a coming version of android for smartphones and tablets tentatively named android l would include new features like smarter authentication and antitheft software if a user is wearing a smartwatch paired with the device he can unlock the phone without entering a passcode when the watch is removed the phone will require a passcode again google also said that android l which will be available in the fall would include a socalled kill switch for rendering a device unusable if it were stolen in android l google overhauled the design of its software system powering smartphones and tablets similar to apple and microsoft google adopted a flat design with more vibrant colors and added effects like shadows and animations for example when a user taps the screen a small water ripple appears on the tapped area google also shared its ambition to push android deeper into areas beyond mobile devices revealing details on android wear a special version of android tailored for smartwatches which it introduced this year google said android wear was customized to show immediately useful information like message notifications the status of a package shipment or the status of traffic for a commuter the smartwatch system is controlled by speaking or by swiping the touch screen when a user is traveling the watch system will continue to bring up relevant contextual information based on his location like the local bus schedule or the weather according to google google said two smartwatches including android wear  samsungs gear live and lgs g watch  would be available to order in its online retail store play on wednesday for television google announced android tv users can speak voice commands into a smartwatch to search for programs and google will find the programs if they are available for purchase in its online play store searching breaking bad for example will bring up the show and information about it users can also stream music and games from their tablets and smartphones to android tv google said it had become partners with sony sharp and asus products including android tv should arrive in the fall google said television has been a tough market for google and android tv is its fourth attempt to push android into television one of its earlier attempts included google tv which came with a clunky remote and many limitations to what people could watch google has found some success with chromecast a stick that plugs into tvs and allows users to stream content from their smartphones or computers to the television released last year chromecast has been a top seller on amazon google on wednesday said it had improved chromecast allowing any phone to connect to the device without having to be on the same wifi network brian blau an analyst for gartner said googles new tv strategy fit much better with its apps and web ecosystem but he noted that with the example of using a smartwatch as a remote for the tv he felt the company was being unrealistic they appeared to be implying that your watch should now be the center of your smart device attention and that just wont be the case he said it makes apps look dumb and less functional google also announced a version of android customized for cars called android auto google said it streamlined the design of the system to keep peoples eyes off the screen and on the road it emphasizes access to maps phone contacts and playlists allowing users to use those features with the tap of a button or voice control the car system will pair with a smartphone in addition the company is also trying to aggressively expand in business computing google showed several changes to its businesses offerings which include things like corporate email and spreadsheets delivered online along with storage and videoconferencing google unveiled additions to drive its online storage service tailored for businesses google said companies would be able to audit which employees were reading what documents more easily encrypt documents and gain access and work with documents stored in older formats like microsoft office all of that is tied with an effort to improve battery life for android devices with a tool called project volta a presentation of the feature was interrupted by a protester who stood in front of the stage holding a banner that read develop a conscience the protester said she was being evicted by a property owner who was a google employee before she was escorted out by security guards soon after she was replaced by another shouting protester who called google a company that builds machines that kill people'

S'mountain view calif reuters  the car stopped at stop signs it glided around curves it didnt lurch or jolt the most remarkable thing about the drive was that it was utterly unremarkable this isnt damning with faint praise its actually high praise for the car in question google incs  driverless car most automotive test drives of which ive done dozens while covering the car industry for nearly  years are altogether different theres a highhorsepower car a hightestosterone automotive engineer and a highspeed race around a test track by a boyracer journalist eager to prove that with just a few more breaks he really could have been you know a nascar driver this test drive in contrast took place on the placid streets of mountain view the silicon valley town that houses googles headquarters the engineers on hand werent highpowered car guys but softspoken alpha geeks of the sort that have emerged as the valleys dominant species and there wasnt any speeding even though ironically googles engineers have determined that speeding actually is safer than going the speed limit in some circumstances thousands and thousands of people are killed in car accidents every year said dmitri dolgov the projects boyish russianborn lead software engineer who now is a us citizen describing his sense of mission this could change that dolgov whos  years old confesses that he drives a subaru instead of a highhorsepower beast not once during an hourlong conversation did he utter the words performance horsepower or zeroto which are mantras at every other newcar test drive instead dolgov repeatedly invoked autonomy the techie term for cars capable of driving themselves google publicly disclosed its driverless car program in  though it began the previous year its part of the companys google x division overseen directly by cofounder sergey brin and devoted to moon shot projects by the internet company as dolgov puts it that might take years if ever to bear fruit so if theres a business plan for the driverless car google isnt disclosing it dolgov who recently drove one of his autonomous creations the  miles  km or so from silicon valley to tahoe and back for a short holiday simply says his mission is to perfect the technology after which the business model will fall into place not winning beauty contests yet judging from my noneventful autonomous trek through mountain view the technology easily handles routine driving the car was a lexus rx h a gaselectric hybrid crossover vehicle  with special modifications of course theres a frontmounted radar sensor for collision avoidance and more conspicuously a revolving cylinder perched above the cars roof thats loaded with lasers cameras sensors and other detection and guidance gear the cylinder is affixed with ugly metal struts signaling that stylistic grace like the business plan has yet to emerge but function precedes form here and that rotating cylinder is a reasonable replacement for the human brain at least some human brains behind the wheel of a car during the minute test ride the drivers seat was occupied by brian torcellini whose title oddly is lead test driver for the driverless car project before joining google the yearold torcellini who studied at san diego state university had hoped to become a surf journalist really now hes riding a different kind of wave he sat behind the test cars steering wheel

wired into the car  the car mapped the route and headed off the only excitement such as it was occurred when an oncoming car seemed about to turn left across our path the driverless car hit the brakes and the driver of the oncoming car quickly corrected course i sat in the back seat not my usual testdriving position right behind torcellini the ride was so smooth and uneventful that except for seeing his hands i wouldnt known that the car was completely piloting itself  steering stopping and starting  lock stock and dipstick googles driverless car is programmed to stay within the speed limit mostly research shows that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are going much faster actually can be dangerous dolgov says so its autonomous car can go up to  mph  kph above the speed limit when traffic conditions warrant not a toy in addition to the model i tested  and other such adapted versions of conventional cars  google also has built little bubbleshaped test cars that lack steering wheels brakes and accelerator pedals they run on electricity seat two people and are limited to going  mph  kph in other words selfdriving golf carts googles isnt the only driverless car in development one of the others is just a few miles away at stanford university where dolgov did postdoctoral study getting the cars to recognize unusual objects and to react properly in abnormal situations remain significant research challenges says professor j christian gerdes faculty director of stanfords revs institute for automotive research beyond that there are ethical issues as he terms them should a car try to protect its occupants at the expense of hitting pedestrians gerdes asks and will we accept it when machines make mistakes even if they make far fewer mistakes than humans  we can significantly reduce risk but i dont think we can drive it to zero that issue in turn raises the question of who is liable when a driverless car is involved in a collision  the cars occupants the auto maker or the software company legal issues might be almost as vexing as technical ones some experts believe selfdriving cars could appear on roads by the end of this decade predicted a detailed report on the budding driverless industry issued late last year by investment bank morgan stanley other experts deem that forecast extremely optimistic but cars with semiautonomous features such as collisionavoidance radar that maintains a safe distance from the car ahead are already on the market and the potential advantages  improved safety less traffic congestion and more  are winning converts to the autonomy cause this is not a toy declared the morgan stanley research report the social and economic implications are enormous for video of a car

VYelp Joins Critics of European Union Antitrust Settlement With Google

S'brussels   yelp the online service increasingly popular on both sides of the atlantic has joined the critics formally opposing the european unions proposed antitrust settlement with google yelp which helps consumers find and review restaurants shops plumbers and all sorts of other local services said in its filing in the longrunning european antitrust case that the results on googles search engine favor google plus local a direct yelp competitor although yelp based in san francisco is a relative minnow compared with google  with annual sales of about  million against googles nearly  billion  it is one of the biggest american companies besides microsoft to have formally opposed the settlement the european unions antitrust commissioner joaqun almunia is eager to complete a deal with google before he leaves office in the autumn the google search engine with about  percent of the market in some european union countries is even more dominant in europe than in the united states local search queries have become a major part of the online world as consumers increasingly turn to the internet for recommendations yelp filed its objection at the beginning of june but it came to light only in recent days in may yelps chief executive jeremy stoppelman wrote a letter to jos manuel barroso the president of the european commission and mr almunias boss about the antitrust proceedings i truly fear the landscape for innovation in europe is infertile and this is a direct result of the abuses google has undertaken with its dominant position mr stoppelman wrote in the letter which was made available by a person who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the correspondence was meant to be private google officials declined to comment on the yelp complaint through the antitrust settlement which mr almunia has been trying to complete with google for more than a year over the continuing objections of the companys competitors google would avoid the possibility of a finding of guilt that could lead to a potential fine of billions of dollars the centerpiece of googles latest provisional deal with mr almunia announced in february is a system that would display rivals search services  for mapping finding hotels and shopping among others  more prominently when people conduct google searches rivals have bitterly complained about the proposal saying that given googles dominance it would do little to help them compete more robustly in europe it is not only american companies like microsoft with its bing search service that have lobbied against the settlement mr almunia has run into strong headwinds from powerful industry groups and politicians in europe particularly in germany the critics are pushing the european commission to abandon plans to settle the case and instead resume the antitrust investigation with the aim of curtailing googles market power over online search and advertising google escaped serious penalties last year after a similar antitrust investigation in the united states  a result that yelp at the time called a missed opportunity under european procedure the commission must consider the latest complaint yelp if its complaint is accepted as part of the continuing case will also have the right to appeal any eventual settlement with google mr almunia told colleagues on june  that he was sticking with his decision to dismiss  formal complaints in the case a legal step before reaching a definitive antitrust settlement it was not clear on tuesday whether the complaint yelp filed on june  was among those a spokesman for mr almunia declined to comment in a speech in london late last month mr almunia said that he still could find that his deal with google may need to be improved but that the current investigation is probably drawing to an end that has not stopped rivals like yelp from continuing to ratchet up pressure on mr almunia  including making an appeal over mr almunias head to mr barroso mr almunias successor has not been chosen but google soon could face a potentially tougher negotiator less willing to make a deal the competition commissioners job is among the most powerful in brussels because the holder can directly order companies that break union law to pay fines of up to  percent of their global annual sales'

VSilicon Valley Tries to Remake the Idea Machine
p892
sg6
S'like any supersecret lab thats supposedly trying to invent the future google x looks rather nondescript from the street besides the occasional hot pink driverless car parked out front the facility is an archipelago of unmarked lowslung redbrick buildings more sunset park than silicon valley inside however whiteboards offer clues about what exactly the future  at least as google sees it  might look like and while some diagrams  including one with parts labeled snooze and set time  suggest more mundane inventions others like one outlining a space elevator seem a bit more ambitious silicon valley where toddleraged companies regularly sell for billions may be the most vibrant sector of the us economy fueling a boom in markets from housing to highend toast how many aslice artisanal bread bars does a place really need but as recent innovations  apps that summon cabs say or algorithms that make people click on ads  have been less than worldchanging there is a fear that the idea machine is slowing down and while silicon valley mythology may suggest that modernday innovation happens in garages and college dorm rooms its own foundations were laid in large part through government research but during the recession government funding began to dwindle the federal government now spends  billion a year on r and d according to the national science foundation its pocket change compared with the  billion that the private sector spends asian economies now account for  percent of global spending americas share is  percent perhaps more crucial the invention of much of the stuff that really created jobs and energized the economy  the internet the mouse smartphones among countless other ideas  was institutionalized oldfashioned innovation factories like xerox parc and bell labs were financed by large companies and operated under the premise that scientists should be given large budgets a supercomputer or two and plenty of time to make discoveries and work out the kinks of their quixotic creations back then after all xerox and att their parent companies made so much money that few shareholders cared about the cost its the unique ingredient of the us business model  not just smart scientists in universities but a critical mass of very smart scientists working in the neighborhood of commercial businesses says adrian slywotzky a partner at oliver wyman the global management consulting firm then that investment was cut way back by the s att was being taken apart by the government xerox parc like other labs was diminished by impatient shareholders and in some cases the very technology it helped create most of the insurgent tech companies with their razor focus on advancing the internet were too preoccupied to set up their own innovation labs they didnt have much of an incentive either startups became so cheap to create  founders can just rent space in the cloud from amazon instead of buying servers and buildings to house them  that it became easier and more efficient for big companies to simply buy new ideas rather than coming up with the framework for inventing them some of googles largest businesses like android and maps were acquired m and a is the new r and d became a popular catchphrase but in the past few years the thinking has changed and tech companies have begun looking to the past for answers in  google opened google x where it is building driverless cars internetconnected glasses balloons that deliver the internet and other things straight out of science fiction microsoft research just announced the opening of a skunkworks group called special projects even bell labs announced this month that it is trying to return to its original mission by finding farout ways to solve realworld problems all of their parent companies however are determined to learn from the mistakes that xerox and att made namely failing to capitalize on their own research its valley lore after all that companies like apple and fairchild semiconductor built their fame and fortune on research done at xerox and bell instead of focusing on basic science research were tackling projects that advance science and solve significant problems says regina dugan the former director of thedefense advanced research projects agency darpa who now runs a small group inside google called advanced technology and projects what this means is youre not compromising this idea of doing really important and interesting science and this sense of it really mattering to put a finer point on it astro teller who oversees google x told me we are not a research center we think of ourselves as a moonshot factory and the reasons for using that phrase is the word moonshot reminds us to be audacious and the word factory reminds us we have to industrialize it in the end there is a decidedly stcentury quality to google x teller dismisses the old academics on steroids model he would know one of his grandfathers gerard debreu won the nobel prize in economics and the other edward teller was an early physicist on the manhattan project instead google x does the inverse it picks products to make then hires people specifically to build them artists and philosophers and designers many of whom dont even know what theyll be working on until they join sample job interview question do you like yellow the idea in other words is to recreate the institutionalized and researchpredicated model of bell labs while also trying to get rich off it there is worry however that if no major company is doing the basic science to invent new things there will be nothing left to invent in a decade a big part of research is just chipping away at a problem says peter lee the head of microsoft research which is a more academicminded r and d group at some point maybe its a decade you suddenly pass a tipping point and completely change the world teller agrees but says its not his concern its absolutely the case that many of the projects were working on rely on the academic work of the last  or  years he said but i dont think places like google x should necessarily be responsible for basic research the word basic implies unguided and unguided is probably best put in governmentfunded universities rather than industry it may take decades to see who is right a new idea once it finds some guidance typically travels along a path from germination to manufacturing to commercialization the united states is good at selling stuff but so are other countries when bell labs was in its heyday america was still very much a manufacturing nation we made cars and steel and everything from televisions to sneakers to processed foods before sending them to consumers worldwide now by and large we make ideas apples big invention wasnt making a better phone it was coming up with the idea in the first place googles founders thought of a better way to search the web and created a service that no one else could replicate now the big silicon valley companies find themselves in the same vulnerable position as the incumbents whose business models they once overturned they know it is only a matter of time before the next big idea puts them out of business  unless they are the ones to come up with it'

S'london  days after europes highest court said people could ask search engines to remove some links about themselves andy donaldson started to receive phone calls mr donaldsons british company hit search had previously created a service for companies and individuals to monitor how and where they were mentioned across the internet now the callers wanted to know how they could take advantage of the courts unexpected decision and hit search  like a growing number of european companies  suddenly saw the potential to profit from europes right to be forgotten ruling its a whole new business opportunity for us said mr donaldson a director at the company people want to protect how they appear in search results he said prices start at  pounds or  a month to monitor how often someone is mentioned online and request that links be removed in may the european court of justice ruled that anyone  people living in europe and potentially those living outside the region  could ask search engines to remove links to online information if they believed the links breached their right to privacy already more than  requests have been made through an online form created by google which runs the dominant search engine in europe but the company has provided little detail about how it decides which links should be removed and only in late june started telling people whether their requests had been successful the confusion around how the ruling should be carried out has created a business opportunity  almost out of thin air hit search already offered a product that allowed people and companies to monitor how often they were mentioned online each day now the service also allows users to identify potential links that they want to be removed from search engines and submit requests online many other companies are offering rival services reputation vip a french startup that helps companies and people manage their online reputations had offered a service costing up to  euros or  a month to help brands or celebrities play down negative publicity by trying to influence what type of links can be found through online searches after the courts decision bertrand girin the companys chief executive created a separate product one aimed at individuals who want help submitting requests to search engines the service includes boilerplate text that people can use for specific cases like removing links to a home address or online references to a divorce the product also allows people to submit requests through the companys website or make them through googles standalone online form so far the service  called forgetme  is free mr girin expects to charge customers eventually however through a socalled freemium model in which people get the basic service free and then pay for premium addons like custommade letters or requests that can be submitted across multiple search engines we saw an opportunity said mr girin who added that his company had so far submitted around  requests related to more than  online links roughly half of the requests had been made on behalf of people in britain france and germany the ruling applies to the nation european union plus norway iceland switzerland and liechtenstein when google put its form online he said we saw there could be a lack of understanding for some people about how to submit requests the land grab from marketing agencies and other startups has not been universally welcomed iain wilson a data protection partner at the law firm brett wilson in london said many of these companies did not understand the legal complexities of the european courts ruling they include decisions on whether the potential case was linked to someones online privacy and how best to submit requests to search engines so they removed the harmful links a lot of reputation management companies are jumping on the bandwagon said mr wilson who had sent letters to google both before and after the courts decision asking for information to be taken down from search results anyone who comes to us with a privacy problem this legal decision is something new in our toolbox while companies are jostling to offer wouldbe customers new ways to send requests to google the majority of the more than  submissions have come through the companys web form google does not charge people to send requests rishi lakhani an independent online marketing consultant in britain said he had made  filings to google on behalf of five clients among the sites that were subjects of requests was one owned by an american newspaper he said even for those companies offering a level of expertise however the request process has not always been smooth simon wadsworth a managing director of igniyte a british online reputation agency said google had rejected almost all of the initial requests made on behalf of his clients many of the submissions failed he said because google insists that links to information in the public interest must remain online he said his company was learning from the failures about which types of requests google would grant mr wadsworth said that even when clients were not covered by the ruling  like companies and people with public profiles  the process has given igniyte a chance to sell other services aimed at cleaning up clients internet reputations that included the creation of online content to promote a positive view of clients to counteract existing online information no one really knows what the criteria is he said in reference to googles response to peoples online requests so far were getting a lot of noes its a complete no mans land'

VPressure Grows on E.U. Regulator to Rethink Google Settlement
p1082

S'brussels  during the past five years google has taken a gingerly approach to fighting its antitrust battles in the european union nurturing a working relationship with joaqun almunia the blocs competition commissioner and patiently presenting him with three sets of proposals to settle antitrust complaints that it favored its own business over that of rivals in search results but lately pressure has mounted on mr almunia to delay  or even jettison  parts of a carefully crafted antitrust settlement it is a worrisome development for google that could spin out an investigation into its search engine and advertising business for many years to come in europe where attitudes to american technology giants have hardened as concerns about their market power and use of private information have mushroomed the political demands in europe for scalps from google is enormous including in the area of antitrust enforcement said nicolas petit a law professor at the university of lige in belgium mr almunia is expected to make a final decision on the google case in september he could still complete the provisional deal he announced in february and ignore the flurry of new complaints that have landed on his desk in recent months but a more aggressive decision by mr almunia derailing that proposed settlement would be far from a complete surprise without a settlement google could be fined up to  percent of its nearly  billion in annual global sales fines have never gone that high but such penalties look set to rise asked about opposition to the settlement including from consumer groups and even mr almunias colleagues google pointed to a comment by a senior executive welcoming the provisional deal the company had offered to make significant changes to the way google operates in europe kent walker googles general counsel said in february after the settlement announcement for months rivals of google  including longstanding complainants like microsoft  and those not associated with microsofts campaign like yelp an american company that lets people find and review local services like restaurants plumbers or pharmacies  have complained that the current deal will do very little to make the online search market more competitive publishing companies like lagardre active in france and axel springer in germany also have weighed in against the proposed settlement the case has even become an issue in how to decide the makeup of the next european commission the bureaucracy that enforces europes antitrust policy looming over mr almunia are hearings that his successor will face at the european parliament many lawmakers want tougher action against google rather than a fiveyear deal that would forestall scrutiny of important areas of googles business until the end of the decade that could add to pressure on mr almunia to abandon the settlement and allow his successor to make a decision ramon tremosa i balcells a member of the parliament from catalonia who sits on the parliaments powerful economics and monetary affairs committee said his message to mr almunias successor on the case was you cannot close this for some years the fast evolution in search particularly in mobile search obliged mr almunias successor to get answers now to the worries that european enterprises and yelp from the united states are also raising in this case he said an important factor pushing mr almunia to consider reversing course involves perceived shortcomings of a proposed settlement that at its heart was intended to give rivals more prominence on the search page google has already gone much further with its concessions in europe than in a similar case where the federal trade commission in the united states decided early last year that the company had not broken antitrust laws but according to a summary of a study testing the deal that yelp showed a variety of european commission officials beginning in march and that was made available this week by a person who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the information still was not public the socalled display remedy would do very little to address a crucial problem identified by mr almunia during his investigation googles ability to give its services preferential treatment yelp said it first responded to investigative inquiries from the european commission in early  making the company a longstanding participant in the proceedings in the examples from yelps evidence shared with the commission this year the current deal would still steer about half of users clicks to areas of a search page managed by google plus local a direct yelp competitor while less than  percent of clicks would go to the system proposed by mr almunia according to the yelp study and according to yelps formal complaint filed may  consumers would still be highly unlikely to get better information on what they are looking for as a result of the settlement google was making it more difficult to find and access information located on competitive properties like yelp even when those properties feature information that is more relevant to consumers than googles own the complaint said to solve the issue yelp called on the regulators to pressure google to use the results from yelp or others like tripadvisor to power googles specialized search products like google plus local when those results do a better job of helping users pinpoint local services on maps and listings in its private meetings with the commission during the spring yelp showed that a search powered by googles own organic product rather than google plus local determined that tripadvisor would return options for seven hotels with  user reviews for the query hotels bilbao spain by comparison google plus local would return seven hotels but with just  reviews'

VA Smartphone Keyboard App That Anticipates What You Want to Type

S'london   typing on the glass of a smartphone can be a headache the keyboards are tiny errors are easy to make even on the simplest of words and autocorrect the function meant to fix typing mistakes often introduces errors switching words that have little to do with what people actually mean consumers irritation with typing has enticed the likes of google apple and several startups to try to put the smart into smartphone keyboards  knowing that there is a big opportunity in having such a prominent place in users hands perhaps no company though has found more success with enhancing keyboards than swiftkey a london startup that first released a keyboard app in  swiftkey says the app which cost  until last wednesday when it became available free was downloaded more than  million times it ranked as one of the most popular paid smartphone applications on googles play store the app predicts what you will type next by using artificial intelligence and reams of online data including what you type on other apps to learn what words you typically use it then applies that information to predict what you will type next theres huge strategic value in owning the keyboard said jon reynolds  a cofounder of swiftkey whose app is now used on almost  million handsets whatever app you use across your phone were there swiftkeys technology and growth have gained the attention of some global tech giants google and facebook for example have made inquiries about a potential takeover of the company though no deal has ever been reached according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such talks a spokeswoman declined to comment about takeover rumors finding a longterm growth plan has not been easy swiftkey announced last week that it was ending its paid app business model instead the app is now free and the company charges users for extras like different colored keyboard themes this socalled freemium model which is popular with online gaming companies like king the maker of the candycrush franchise is an effort by swiftkey to woo new consumers particularly in developing markets in countries like india and china people often balk at paying for smartphone apps preferring to download them free and pay for premium content china represents the next billion smartphone users said ben medlock  a swiftkey cofounder the freemium model will help us to build our user base so far the app has been limited to android which allows thirdparty developers like swiftkey to alter the look and feel of the operating system swiftkey has also teamed with handset makers including samsung and lg and the app is installed on many of their new highend phones yet while the startup is still looking to increase its users on android which has roughly  percent of the global smartphone market and typically is used in lowcost models swiftkey also wants to attract apple users this month apple announced it was opening its keyboard to thirdparty apps like swiftkey the startup had already teamed with evernote the popular notetaking app to offer its predictive keyboard on apples iphones but now swiftkey says it is working on a keyboard app that will work across apple smartphone software as the android experience gets better apple will have to consider opening up more said richard wong a partner at the venture capital firm accel partners in california which has invested in swiftkey despite phones becoming smart most apps have remained dumb finding success with apple will not be easy while apple said other companies could develop apps for its operating system apple also introduced its own predictive keyboard that it will include on its new mobile operating system  a keyboard that operates a lot like swiftkeys product that could make it hard to persuade users to download a separate keyboard app you need to have control of the operating system said nick dillon a senior analyst at the technology research company ovum in london that favors apple and google for swiftkey theres a limit to what they can do swiftkey has built its success so far on personalization by mining data from its users and other online sources the startup can offer different text predictions for each individual depending on how they type what their interests are and which language they use an american user for example might be prompted to use the word soccer in a text message related to the world cup in brazil while a british user would be offered football in total swiftkey now offers word predictions in  languages including mongolian and welsh it is running a trial of a japanese version and soon plans to introduce a chinese edition we tap into a lot of different sources  its the best way to figure out what people are trying to type said joe osborne who leads swiftkeys text prediction team from the getgo we can understand exactly how you write swiftkey can personalize its keyboard according to what and how each person writes across emails social networks like facebook and mobile internet searches on google users have the option to link their online accounts to the apps predictive text algorithms swiftkey then analyzes their personal habits on the likes of twitter to tailor its suggestions to each user the company says it complies with european data protection rules which are more stringent than those in the united states swiftkey also says people must opt in to add their accounts to its system and they are not automatically signed up for the personalization service as part of swiftkeys global rollout caroline gasperin a brazilian who runs the companys language group spent more than two years working on the japanese version before its introduction last month her person team had to crack the complexity of predicting words in the characterbased language the process took two years  in contrast to less than a week needed to build a similar model for a european language we started the company to make a better keyboard said mr reynolds the cofounder from the beginning our focus has been to get on a billion handsets'

S'san francisco   a us consumer lawsuit accusing google of monopolizing prime real estate on android smartphones will help mobile rivals like microsoft make their antitrust case with european regulators should damaging secrets emerge in court the suit filed in california federal court in may by two smartphone consumers said google requires handset manufacturers such as samsung electronics co ltd to restrict competing apps like microsofts bing search on android phones partly by making googles own apps the default google argued last week the proposed class action should be dismissed because consumers still are free to use the other apps the plaintiffs counter that most consumers either dont know how to switch default settings or will not go to the trouble if a judge lets the lawsuit proceed plaintiffs attorneys would be allowed to delve into internal google emails and contracts with smartphone companies and could interview google executives under oath said steve berman who represents the consumers im confident we will get into juicy stuff and i think that will up the pressure on google as some of the material we discover becomes public he said google declined to comment a hearing on googles bid to dismiss the case is scheduled for october any damaging evidence from the class action would play into the hands of googles rivals microsoft spokesman jack evans said the company is not a party to the consumer lawsuit but last year a group of companies  including microsoft oracle nokia expedia and tripadvisor  filed a complaint with european antitrust regulators over some of the same issues in the us lawsuit google apps are widely used on android by requiring default placement and other mechanisms for disadvantaging competing apps the companies said in a summary of their complaint google last year said it was working cooperatively with european regulators who have yet to decide whether to formally investigate microsoft ties berman has a long history of taking on large us companies he reached a settlement for consumers suing apple over its ebook sales practices that could reach  million and  settled for  billion a lawsuit on behalf of toyota car owners with unintended acceleration claims but the seattlebased plaintiffs lawyer also has represented one of googles main rivals berman defended microsoft when it faced its own antitrust investigations over windows berman said he has had conversations with microsoft over the years about googles conduct but not about this lawsuit no stranger to antitrust inquiries google was scrutinized by us and european regulators over allegations that it improperly manipulated search results to rank its own services higher than competitors us authorities ultimately closed their investigation without filing a lawsuit and europes competition commissioner negotiated a settlement earlier this year which is awaiting approval by the broader european commission prime real estate the main issue for us courts will be whether android and mobile services like search are technically separate or tied in ways that impedes competition for consumers said michael cusumano a professor at the mit sloan school of management cusumano has extensively researched microsoft which unsuccessfully sued the professor in the s for access to his notes this year microsoft has sought to hire him to write an expert opinion in an unrelated proceeding the us consumer lawsuit is based largely on contracts between google and android manufacturers samsung and htc that became public during oracles separate  trial against google if samsung or htc wishes to use google apps on its phones the consumer lawsuit said they must preload a suite of services  including youtube and maps  on prime screen real estate on the phones and set google search as the default it also argues that googles deal with apple to be the default search on iphones and ipads locks out competitors across the mobile universe apple does not have its own search engine has lower market share worldwide than android and is not a defendant in the case googles deals with handset makers do not prevent rival search engines from reaching consumers through the various distribution channels available to them google wrote in its motion to dismiss the us lawsuit cusumano said the us class action could hurt google if a judge finds that it improperly pushes its mapping and location services which is embedded across the android system its kind of a pandoras box to look inside what google does and the relationship it has with all these smartphone and handset manufacturers he said additional reporting by bill rigby in seattle editing by howard goller'

S'london   eoin mckeogh knows how hard it can be to make the internet forget he started waging a court battle against the likes of google facebook and yahoo after a dublin cabdriver posted a video in  that showed someone who looked like him  but wasnt  bailing on his cab fare mr mckeogh a university student who was in japan at the time was pilloried on the internet after an anonymous user falsely named him as the fare dodger while the original video was taken down long ago mr mckeogh continues to fight in court to expunge the digital trail he is among the thousands of europeans trying to erase their online histories in france a mother recently sought to remove photos of her scantily clad teenage daughter from a website in romania a woman tried to curtail online access to records of her divorce in britain a former politician wanted to delete google links to a book he viewed as defamatory toward him such efforts have accelerated after a landmark decision by the european high court this month that will require google and other search providers to consider individuals requests to remove links that they say infringe on their privacy in the first few days after the ruling about  europeans asked google to take down links with about half having criminal convictions and half not according to people briefed on the requests the requests included an actor seeking to expunge links to articles about an affair with an underage girl and a doctor seeking to take down negative reviews search companies will face a considerable challenge in responding to the requests google alone handled more than  million requests in the last month to remove links to copyrighted material around the world but much of those efforts are automated and address straightforward issues like taking down a link to a stolen movie dealing with individuals who bring complaints in europe promises to be more complex because it would most likely require additional employees to grapple with less clearcut decisions google now has a web form for europeans to request that links be removed the company also said it plans to create an advisory committee to cultivate a public conversation about these issues while the ruling appears to newly enshrine a right to be forgotten europe has long taken an aggressive stance on individual rights in the digital age each nation in the european union already has a data protection agency through which citizens can appeal for help in erasing their online histories the court decision stems from a case brought by a spaniard mario costeja gonzlez who was concerned about the prominence given by google to a short newspaper notice from the s about a house he owned being sold off to pay debts i was never worried about my online image i was worried about the impact on my work mr costeja gonzlez a lawyer said in a brief interview i have always been in favor of freedom of expression but the tech industry has portrayed the decision as a blow against the free flow of information on the web and a victory for those who want to cover up past misdeeds  including pedophiles corrupt politicians and unscrupulous businesspeople a simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know from googles perspective thats a balance eric schmidt googles executive chairman said in recent comments on the decision google believes having looked at the decision which is binding that the balance that was struck was wrong historically many requests have been aimed at blocking wider access to what many would view as part of the public domain indaco systems a romanian company operates a website that publishes romanian court proceedings which are released by the government the company has received hundreds of complaints this year from citizens who are concerned about public access to court filings that involve them many of the complaints are spurred by google links leading to the case records adrian nicolaide a lawyer for indaco said the information is either public  and in this case anyone should have access to it  or it is not public and the public should have no free access google indexing official public information leads that information to a whole new level of publicity but it does not infringe the very purpose of public information he added the ruling also reflects the historically divergent views on privacy between the united states and europe and it comes alongside deep mistrust of american technology spurred by the revelations about the united states governments mass surveillance practices the court ruling echoes what we identify as a social trend which is the will of the individuals to master their online life said isabelle falquepierrotin the chairwoman of the french data protection agency her agency is already taking in about  complaints a year from people who want internet content or links taken down she said she said the recent ruling was almost immediately cited in complaints coming into her agency its much too early to say its going to lead to an automatic increase but i was surprised that within  hours some people who were complaining were mentioning this court ruling she said lawyers are very efficient once a contested item is online however the genie will not easily go back in the bottle in mr mckeoghs case an irish judge indicated the taxi video could still be found and compelled the technology companies to take steps to remove tags threads and other means by which the material remains accessible and viewable all manner of nasty and seemingly idle minds got to work on the plaintiff and as seems to happen with apparent impunity nowadays on social media sites said whatever things first came into their vacant idle and meddlesome heads judge michael peart of dublin wrote last year when he granted mr mckeogh an injunction in a case mr mckeoghs lawyer declined requests for comment citing the litigation the case is now being considered by the irish supreme court judge peart in one of his rulings noted the complexities of mr mckeoghs quest this court does not have a magic wand he wrote the damage has already been done and it is impossible to unring the bell that has sounded so loudly europeans have a long history of trying to reclaim their privacy consider the case of alexandre dumas in  dumas the yearold french author of the count of monte cristo posed for a series of what were seen as racy pictures with adah menken a much younger american actress who was rumored to be his mistress she posed in her underwear in some of the photos and cuddled with dumas in others a scandal followed when some of the pictures were published and dumas went to the french courts to try to get them back privacy is deeply connected with the protection of personal honor in europe said james q whitman a yale law professor who wrote a detailed study contrasting european and american privacy policies the european understanding is that public dissemination of embarrassing facts about ones past could undermine ones sense of honor and standing in society he added american privacy law isnt really dedicated in the same way to protecting personal honor or social standing in  the french courts ruled that a right to privacy superseded the photographers property rights and ordered the photos be sold back to dumas still some of them can be seen today on the internet'

S'there is little doubt that the technology behind driverless cars is nearly advanced enough for mainstream use google plans to make its biggest public display yet of its cars on tuesday when it takes reporters on spins around mountain view calif carmakers like bmw and toyota are also preparing to sell cars that drive themselves instead the bigger question about driverless cars is a legal one who is responsible when something goes wrong driverless cars are supposed to be much safer than cars driven by people because they dont make human errors but accidents seem inevitable what happens when a driverless car kills someone or less drastically who pays the ticket when it doesnt notice a noparking sign or when an error in google maps sends it the wrong way down a oneway street as robots become mainstream lawmakers will have to grapple with how to govern machines and hold software accountable only four states and the district of columbia have passed laws specific to driverless cars some just allowing manufacturers to test cars and none answering every legal question that might come up but lawyers academics and the cars designers say none of these issues are likely to prevent selfdriving cars from hitting the road because current liability laws already provide some guidance a bigger obstacle than the law might turn out to be peoples own visceral fears of robots here is what to expect in cases of parking or traffic tickets the owner of the car would most likely be held responsible for paying the ticket even if the car and not the owner broke the law in the case of a crash that injures or kills someone many parties would be likely to sue one another but ultimately the cars manufacturer like google or bmw would probably be held responsible at least for civil penalties product liability law which holds manufacturers responsible for faulty products tends to adapt well to new technologies john villasenor a fellow at the brookings institution and a professor at ucla wrote in a paper last month proposing guiding principles for driverless car legislation a manufacturers responsibility for problems discovered after a product is sold  like a faulty software update for a selfdriving car  is less clear mr villasenor wrote but there is legal precedent particularly with cars as anyone following the recent spate of recalls knows the cars could make reconstructing accidents and assigning blame in lawsuits more clearcut because the car records video and other data about the drive said sebastian thrun an inventor of driverless cars i often joke that the big losers are going to be the trial lawyers he said insurance companies would also benefit from this data and might even reward customers for using driverless cars mr villasenor wrote ryan calo who studies robotics law at the university of washington school of law predicted a renaissance in nofault car insurance under which an insurer covers damages to its customer regardless of who is at fault criminal penalties are a different story for the simple reason that robots cannot be charged with a crime criminal law is going to be looking for a guilty mind a particular mental state  should this person have known better mr calo said if youre not driving the car its going to be difficult the first deadly accident could be a bigger headache for the carmakers public relations department than for its lawyers its the one headline machine kills child rather than the  obituaries we have every year from humans killed on the roads said bryant walker smith a fellow at stanford universitys center for automotive research its the fear of robots theres something scarier about a machine malfunctioning and taking away control from somebody we saw that in the toyota unintended acceleration cases when people would describe their horror at feeling like they could lose control of their car robot cars scare people less than some other new technologies though nearly half of americans say they would ride in one according to pew research center making them a much more popular than innovations like drones or implantable memory chips so perhaps the biggest question about driverless cars is when can we use one'
