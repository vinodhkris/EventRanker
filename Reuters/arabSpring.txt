S'isa town bahrain  earlier this month aqeel abdul mohsen  was shot in the face for protesting against bahrains government he was covered in blood with the lower side of his face blown open his jaw shattered and a broken hand hanging awkwardly from his wrist its one of those images that you wish you had never seen and can never forget         after more than  hours of surgery and before mr abdul mohsen regained consciousness his hospital room was already under guard by the police had he been able to speak he might even have been interrogated before going into surgery others have lain bleeding without medical attention while government security agents asked questions like were you participating in a protest who else was with you         bahrain a small island nation off the coast of saudi arabia has been ruled by the khalifa family for more than  years it is also home to the headquarters of the united states navys fifth fleet which patrols regional shipping lanes assists with missions in iraq and afghanistan and monitors iran as tensions in the region mount         the oppressed people of bahrain joined the arab spring soon after the fall of president hosni mubarak in egypt with newfound hope bahrainis took to the streets on feb   rich and poor shiite and sunni liberal and religious they felt what it was like to speak freely for the first time in the capital manama at a traffic circle with a pearl monument at its center the pearl roundabout came to symbolize the bahraini revolution         but this newfound freedom didnt last long the governments security forces attacked the peaceful protesters then tore down the pearl monument and in march  troops from neighboring saudi arabia and the united arab emirates intervened to suppress our prodemocracy protests         going out on the streets carrying nothing but a flag and calling for democracy could cost you your life here chanting down with the dictator could lead to your being subjected to electric shocks giving a speech about human rights and democracy can lead to life imprisonment infants have died after suffocating from toxic gases used by riot police and teenage protesters have been shot and killed         its not unusual in bahrain to find families with four or five members in prison at the same time my father abdulhadi alkhawaja was beaten unconscious in my apartment in front of my family as a report last year by the bahrain independent commission of inquiry documented he was then taken away with my husband and brotherinlaw they were all tortured         my husband was released in january and my brotherinlaw was released after a sixmonth sentence in late  my father was sentenced to life in prison he staged four hunger strikes the longest lasted  days and almost cost him his life he was forcefed at a military hospital         but despite all these sacrifices the struggle for freedom and democracy in bahrain seems hopeless because bahrains rulers have powerful allies including saudi arabia and the united states         for bahrainis there doesnt seem to be much of a difference between the saudis and the americans both are supporting the khalifa regime to preserve their own interests even if the cost is the lives and rights of the people of bahrain         the united states speaks about supporting human rights and democracy but while the saudis send troops to aid the khalifa government america is sending arms the united states is doing itself a hugedisservice by displaying such an obvious double standard toward human rights violations in the middle east washington condemns the violence of the syrian government but turns a blind eye to blatant human rights abuses committed by its ally bahrain         this double standard is costing america its credibility across the region and the message being understood is that if you are an ally of america then you can get away with abusing human rights         if the united states is serious about protecting human rights in the arab world it should halt all arms sales to bahrain bring bahrains abuses to the attention of the united nations security council support a special session on bahrain at the united nations human rights council and begin a conversation about potential diplomatic and economic sanctions the obama administration should also demand that highlevel bahraini officials be held accountable for human rights abuses and that nongovernmental organizations united nations human rights investigators and journalists be allowed to enter the country and investigate abuses         at present the bahraini government believes it has international immunity it commits widespread human rights violations and business continues as usual the government continues to buy arms and negotiate lucrative deals without having to face any real consequences this is why the most prominent bahraini humanrights defenders are languishing in prison until the united states starts to put real pressure on its ally bahrains government has no incentive to change         no matter the price bahrainis will keep demanding the very values  human rights and democracy  that the united states claims to stand for it is an outrage that america continues to back a regime that tramples them        '

VIran\u2019s Slowing of Enrichment Efforts May Show It Wants a Deal, Analysts Say
p85
sg6
S'washington  by subtly putting its hands on the brakes of its uranium enrichment efforts iran may be signaling that it wants to avoid a direct confrontation over its nuclear program at least in the near term according to united states and other western officials the action has also led some analysts to conclude that irans leaders are showing signs that theymay be more interested in a deal to end the nuclear standoff with the west          evidence began emerging last summer that the iranians were diverting a significant portion of their mediumenriched uranium for use in a small research reactor converting it into a form that cannot easily be used in a weapon         one american official said the move amounted to trying to put more time on the clock to solve this characterizing it as a step you have to assume was highly calculated because everything the iranians do in a negotiation is highly calculated israels departing defense minister ehud barak came to a similar conclusion when he said in october that his country could safely back away from threats of military action against iran at least until the late spring or summer of          but white house state department and pentagon officials all cautioned against drawing firm conclusions about irans ultimate intentions         a new session of talks involving iran and six major powers including the united states is expected next year and american officials say they still cannot determine whether irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei is ready to strike a deal         a quiet feeler seeking direct talks with iran that the administration put out after president obamas reelection last month resulted in no real response another senior official said adding it wasnt that they said yes or no they said nothing         these uncertainties underlie the hunger in western countries to understand why iran appears to be keeping its stockpile of mediumenriched uranium  which could be converted to bomb fuel in weeks or months  to a level below the amount necessary to build a single weapon         evidence from a variety of sources including the international atomic energy agency suggests that as iran produced more uranium enriched to near  percent purity a process that takes it most of the way to bombgrade fuel it began diverting some into an oxide powder that could be used in a small research reactor in tehran that diversion is believed to have begun in august         iran had been complaining for years that the research reactor which was supplied by the united states during the rule of shah mohammed reza pahlavi to produce isotopes for medical purposes was running out of fuel and that the west refused to sell it more so it decided to make the fuel itself now even though it has enough fuel to keep the reactor running for at least a decade it may be making more several sources indicate         the statistics released in quarterly reports by the atomic energy agency show that if iran had not diverted fuel to that project it would have enough mediumenriched fuel for one bomb and would be on its way to enough for a second instead as of the agencys last report in november iran had enriched  kilograms about  pounds of the fuel nearly enough to produce a weapon but more than  kilograms almost  pounds had been sent off for fabrication into fuel plates for the reactor once turned to that purpose the fuel is very difficult to use in a bomb         the diversion was a move to take heat away so that things didnt go over the tipping point said olli heinonen the former head of inspections for the atomic energy agency who dealt with iran extensively mr heinonen now a senior fellow at the kennedy school of government at harvard said that since the diversion the iranians had continued to produce about  kilograms about  pounds a month of mediumenriched fuel so unless they slow that pace or divert more fuel to the reactor program they are going back up to the tipping point he said         iran could use that to its advantage in negotiations i think it is hard to understand what iran was doing if not sending a deliberate signal signaling some cautiousness said greg thielmann a former state department intelligence analyst who is now at the arms control association i think it is reasonable to see the diversion as a negotiating signal and a note of moderation         ray takeyh an iran specialist at the council on foreign relations said that the sanctions policy that the united states has pursued over the past decade is beginning to bear fruit he said that the steps which have led to a huge devaluation of the iranian currency and a sharp decline in iranian oil exports have seemingly succeeded in convincing influential sectors of the theocracy to reconsider their options         some arab officials agree though they warn that it could be three years before the sanctions hurt iran enough to bring about a change of position the problem is we dont have three years a senior arab diplomat said recently         the big question is whether any of this is more than tactical positioning tehran almost certainly hopes the diversion will be read in western capitals as a sign of its willingness to reach a deal said paul r pillar a former cia analyst who is now at georgetown university        '

S'islamabad pakistan  they are dead men talking and they know it gulping nervously the prisoners stare into the video camera spilling tales of intrigue betrayal and paid espionage on behalf of the united states some speak in trembling voices a glint of fear in their eyes others look resigned all plead for their lives         i am a spy and i took part in four attacks said sidinkay a young tribesman who said he was paid  to help direct cia drones to their targets in pakistans tribal belt sweat glistened on his forehead he rocked nervously as he spoke stay away from the americans he said in an imploring voice stay away from their dollars         al qaeda and the taliban have few defenses against the american drones that endlessly prowl the skies over the bustling militant hubs of north and south waziristan in northwestern pakistan along the afghan border cia missiles killed at least  people in  most of them islamist militants according to watchdog groups that monitor the strikes the dead included abu yahya allibi the qaeda ideologue and deputy leader         despite the technological superiority of their enemy however the militants do possess one powerful countermeasure         for several years now militant enforcers have scoured the tribal belt in search of informers who help the cia find and kill the spy agencys jihadist quarry the militants technique  often more witch hunt than investigation  follows a wellestablished pattern accused tribesmen are abducted from homes and workplaces at gunpoint and tortured a sham religious court hears their case usually declaring them guilty then they are forced to speak into a video camera         the taped confessions which are later distributed on cd vary in style and content but their endings are the same execution by hanging beheading or firing squad         in sidinkays last moments the camera shows him standing in a dusty field with three other prisoners all blindfolded illuminated by car headlights a volley of shots rings out and the three others are mowed down but sidinkay apparently untouched is left standing for a tragic instant he shuffles about confused then fresh shots ring out and he too crumples to the ground         these macabre recordings offer a glimpse into a littleseen side of the drone war in waziristan a paranoid shadow conflict between militants and a faceless american enemy in which ordinary pakistanis have often become unwitting victims         outside the tribal belt the issue of civilian casualties has dominated the debate about american drones at least  noncombatants have been killed by ciadirected strikes since  according to monitoring groups  a toll frequently highlighted by critics of the drones like the pakistani politician imran khan still strike accuracy seems to be improving just seven civilian deaths have been confirmed in  down from  the previous year according to the bureau of investigative journalism which has been critical of the obama administrations drone campaign         and civilian lives are threatened by militants too as the american campaign has cut deeply into the commands of both the taliban and al qaeda dronefearing militants have turned to local communities for reprisals mounting a concerted campaign of fear and intimidation that has claimed dozens of lives and further stressed the already fragile order of tribal society         the video messages from those accused of spying are intended to send a stark message regardless of whether innocents are among those caught up in the deadly dragnet the confessions are delivered at gunpoint and usually follow extensive torture including hanging from hooks for up to a month human rights groups say         in every civilized society the penalty for spying is death said a senior commander with the pakistani taliban speaking on the condition of anonymity from waziristan         although each of the myriad militant factions in waziristan operates its own death squads by far the most formidable is the ittehademujahedeen khorasan a shadowy group that experts consider to be al qaedas local counterintelligence wing since it emerged in  the group which is led by arab and uzbek militants has carefully cultivated a sinister image through video theatrics and the ruthless application of violence         blackclad khorasan militants their faces covered in balaclavas roam across north waziristan in jeeps with tinted windows in one video clip from  khorasan fighters are seen searching traffic under a cluster of palm trees outside mir ali a notorious militant hub then they move into the town center distributing leaflets to shoppers before executing three men outside a gas station         spies your days are numbered because we are carrying out raids chants the video soundtrack         thought to number dozens of militants the khorasan cooperates closely with the afghan warlord jalaluddin haqqani who is based in north waziristan a sister organization in afghanistan has been responsible for  assassinations and executions according to american military intelligence        '

S'if you havent finished your holiday shopping yet dont bother         skip the mall and the neighborhood store resist the urge to shop online and by all means dont buy anything you dont truly need         so says kalle lasn  maestro of the proudly radical magazine adbusters published in vancouver british columbia mr lasn takes gleeful pleasure in lobbing provocations at global corporations  and his latest salvo is buy nothing christmas         as our planet gets warmer as animals go extinct as the humans get sicker as our economies bail and our politicians grow ever more twisted americans just go shopping adbusters says on its web site overconsumption is destroying us yet shopping is our solace our sedative consumerism is the opiate of the masses         weve got to break the habit mr lasn said in a telephone interview it will be a shock but weve got to shift to a new paradigm otherwise im afraid will be facing a new dark age         of course retailers will be facing a dark age if people really stop shopping and because consumer spending accounts for roughly  percent of united states gross domestic product an abrupt shift to nonconsumption would drive the already faltering economy to its knees         there are no signs that consumers are heeding mr lasns call says marshal cohen chief retail analyst at the npd group i find that people are shoppers or theyre not he said shoppers keep shopping         so its easy to dismiss this latest campaign as yet another empty gesture from a figure on the radical fringe why take mr lasns words seriously         well last year a campaign prompted by mr lasn and his magazine improbably caught fire it was occupy wall street         adbusters gave occupy its name and opening date and designed the poster with occupys defining image an elegant ballerina perched atop wall streets raging bull while gasmasked figures loomed in the background the poster contained this text what is our one demand occupywallstreet sept th bring tent a digital version went viral         mr lasns main role in the zuccotti park occupation however pretty much ended there he remained in vancouver never visiting the lower manhattan encampment and participating in the local organizational work that made it possible but his contribution began long before then         born in estonia mr lasn lived for several years in german resettlement camps with his parents after they fled the advancing soviet army toward the end of world war ii the family moved to australia when he was  he graduated from the university of adelaide where he studied theoretical and applied mathematics and then worked four years for the australian military writing computer code for war games         then he moved to tokyo where the skills he developed in australia served him well he started a market research company and he says did computerbased studies of ad campaigns for global corporations the work was lucrative and he used his money to see the world it was  and a leftwing student rebellion in paris resonated worldwide he says he imbibed the spirit of rebellion and it changed him         until occupy the greatest political movement id ever seen was the uprising of  it really inspired me and ive been running on that energy  and have been trying to recapture it  ever since         last year he says he did recapture it stirred by the uprisings in algeria tunisia and egypt  the arab spring  he and colleagues at adbusters began to consider the possibilities of achieving a soft regime change in the united states of finding some way to tap into the revolutionary zeitgeist out of those discussions came the idea of occupy wall street         max haiven a postdoctoral fellow in art and public policy at new york university who has studied adbusters for years said that was a fantastic initiative for them theyve been in global anticonsumption battles for years and adbusters has called for many big campaigns that never really happened this one did in a way they got lucky         he added what led to occupy wall street taking off was not just the iconic image of the ballerina and the bull but a number of factors  including ontheground activists building an organization through many many meetings and relationships and hard work in new york and elsewhere adbusters didnt do that other people did it         mr lasn acknowledges the truth of that and says hes not a community organizer and certainly not a graceful politician ive said some things that have pissed people off he says and its not just corporations like nike mcdonalds and philip morris that have been stung by him israels policies toward palestinians are an adbusters target        '

S'fort meade md  in a halfempty courtroom here with a crew of fervent supporters in attendance pfc bradley manning and his lawyer have spent the last two weeks turning the tables on the government         private manning faces a potential life sentence if convicted on charges that he gave wikileaks the antisecrecy organization hundreds of thousands of confidential military and diplomatic documents but for now he has been effectively putting on trial his former jailers at the quantico va marine corps base his lawyer david e coombs has grilled one quantico official after another demanding to know why his client was kept in isolation and stripped of his clothing at night as part of suicideprevention measures         mr coombs a polite but relentless interrogator who stands a foot taller than his client has laid bare deep disagreements inside the military psychiatrists thought the special measures unnecessary while jail commanders ignored their advice and kept the suicide restrictions in place in a long day of testimony last week private manning of the army vilified as a dangerous traitor by some members of congress but lauded as a warcrimes whistleblower on the political left heartened his sympathizers with an eloquent and even humorous performance on the stand         he was engaged chipper optimistic said bill wagner  a retired nasa solar physicist who is a courtroom regular dressed in the black truth tshirt favored by private mannings supporters         private manning who turns  on dec  and looks much younger was quietly attentive during fridays court session in a dress uniform crewcut blond hair and wirerimmed glasses if his face were not already familiar from television news he might have been mistaken for a firstyear law student assisting the defense team         it seemed incongruous that he has essentially acknowledged responsibility for the largest leak of classified material in history the material included a quartermillion state department cables whose release may have chilled diplomats ability to do their work discreetly but also helped fuel the arab spring video of american helicopter crews shooting people on the ground in baghdad who they thought were enemy fighters but were actually reuters journalists field reports on the wars in iraq and afghanistan and confidential assessments of the detainees locked up at guantnamo bay cuba         as the military pursues the case against private manning the justice department continues to explore the possibility of charging wikileaks founder julian assange or other activists with the group possibly as conspirators in private mannings alleged offense federal prosecutors in alexandria va are still assigned to that investigation according to law enforcement officials but it is not clear how active they have been lately in presenting evidence to a grand jury         the current tone of the legal proceedings against private manning is most likely temporary his lawyer is asking the judge overseeing the case to throw out the charges on the ground that his pretrial treatment was unlawful but that outcome appears unlikely         as a fallback mr coombs is hoping the court will at least give private manning extra credit against any ultimate sentence for the time he spent held under harsh conditions at quantico and earlier in kuwait where he was kept in what he described as an animal cage after the uproar about his treatment including public criticism from the state departments top spokesman and the united nations top torture expert military officials moved private manning in april  from quantico to a new prison at fort leavenworth kan where he has not faced the same restrictions on clothing sleeping conditions and conversation with other inmates         as if to underscore the gravity of his legal predicament private manning offered last month to plead guilty to lesser charges that could send him to prison for  years prosecutors have not said whether they are interested in such a deal which would mean they would have to give up seeking a life sentence for the most serious charges aiding the enemy and violating the espionage act         fridays court session was attended by a dozen manning loyalists including thomas a drake the former national security agency official who was accused of leaking documents and pleaded guilty to a minor charge last year they heard the commander of the quantico brig or military jail explain why she refused private mannings request to be taken off prevention of injury status        '

S'art books many of us cant live without them but sooner or later we cant live with them either first we run out of shelves then table space gets scarce and soon stacks of books start rising from the floor luckily these conditions stop no one from publishing them or from buying them or giving them as gifts         this years offerings confirm once more the variety of genres that thrive beneath the art book banner there are the standard artists monographs for example among which johannes graves  caspar david friedrich prestel  stands out primarily for its size and lavish reproductions  a total of  nearly all in color  of paintings drawings and prints by this great german romantic it conveys a fuller sense of friedrichs enigmatic landscapecentered art than any single museum or exhibition could possibly provide         mr graves rather pedestrian text while rich with interesting information and hypotheses about the works never really gets going but the pictures more than compensate they could easily inspire a friedrich pilgrimage to various mostly german museums         in the category of books by rather than about artists one of the most stunning is chris wares new graphic novel building stories pantheon books  which elliptically tells the tale of a smart fatalistic unnamed young woman who happens to have a prosthetic leg and of her search for love as usual mr wares style is a model of compression in both word and picture less usual for the genre as a whole is the vividness with which he limns his heroines intense if fairly ordinary inner life and also the brilliant way he avoids the visual relentlessness that can plague graphic novels         he accomplishes this last feat by spreading his story over  distinctively discrete books booklets magazines newspapers and pamphlets as the text on the illustrated box they come in puts it varying considerably in size length and design these entities offer no clues about sequence the reader is left to piece together a multistrand narrative whose characters also include other residents of the chicago brownstone in which the woman lives  an unhappily unmarried couple and the spinster landlady  as well as the building itself the lack of clear structure much less traditional linearity turns reading into an unusually active process this is a great easily ownable work of art         then there are books that offer a fresh and sweeping view of an entire lost culture this is the case with wari lords of the ancient andes cleveland museum of artthames  hudson  the thick scholarly book published to accompany an apparently extraordinary exhibition at the cleveland museum of art through jan  it will travel to the museum of artfort lauderdale in florida and the kimbell art museum in fort worth         the anthropomorphic ceramics and patterned textiles abstract figurative abstractly figurative produced during the wari empire ad  to  are staples of any museum display of precolumbian art nonetheless the breadth of the cultural achievement of the wari who preceded the betterknown incas in the highlands of peru has never been so thoroughly demonstrated or explicated         overseen by susan e bergh organizer of the exhibition and a curator at the cleveland museum this lavishly illustrated often breathtakingly beautiful book pulls together essays by more than a dozen scholars historical and geographical contexts are detailed and there are essays covering architecture religious deities and rituals textiles and feather work sculpture and inlaid and metal ornaments for a sense of the revelations in store consider the fullpage reproduction on page  of a wari urn decorated with delicate and varied plant forms that presages american and european folk art motifs by several hundred years         another volume that explores a far more familiar bit of art history and makes it fresh is drawing surrealism delmonico booksprestel  the catalog to an exhibition at the los angeles county museum of art that will travel to the morgan library  museum in new york in late january the restless nature of surrealist drawing  from hyperrealism to freeform automatism with the collaborative exquisite corpse technique falling somewhere in between  is well established overseen like the show by leslie jones a curator at the los angeles museum and isabelle dervaux of the morgan this invaluable book presents a profusion of unfamiliar works and even better unfamiliar talents from  countries around the globe it reveals the truly international nature of surrealism enriching the understanding of this already richly polymorphous style         as for even more recent art history it can be presented in many ways including as an informationdense handbook this is the case with alternative histories new york art spaces  to  mit press  a kind of fleshedout multivoiced timeline of the citys alternative spaces it was edited by lauren rosati and mary anne staniszewski for a show

S'amman  on a warm day late last month a crowd filed into a white tent outside the royal palaces in amman to hear a muchanticipated speech by king abdullah ii on the countrys political future         although the invitees included various dignitaries  former politicians tribal leaders journalists even islamists  they included only a few women and when the men interrupted the speech to chant loyalty slogans those few seemed to disappear from sight entirely         in his speech the king encouraged participation in the elections which are expected in january and spoke about street protests saying calls for overthrowing the regime were regrettable he said that every individual in this society is part of this regime but he failed to mention the current struggle for womens rights in jordan which he has mentioned in the past         since popular uprisings swept the region the jordanian government has stated that political and economic reforms are key to the countrys future stability and prosperity yet despite the formation of numerous committees and commissions there has been little emphasis on womens issues         womens rights have played only a limited role in demonstrations some female demonstrators have called for children they have had with nonjordanian husbands to gain citizenship while some women have been active in street protests they have mostly focused on calls for broader economic and political changes         jordan is a relatively poor country with almost  percent of its population living under the poverty line as with other countries in the region unemployment is high especially among women and youth         among jordanians with advanced degrees twothirds of those without jobs are women  despite  percent of graduates over the past decade being female according to the department of statistics         we know that throughout history women in jordan stood against colonialism and defended the homeland they were out protesting in the streets and played an integral part of building this country but today we are failing to achieve equality said abla abu elbeh secretary general of the jordanian peoples democratic party and a former member of parliament         we are failing this generation  she said         women remain largely absent from key leadership positions in what could be a crucial period in the countrys history for instance when a national dialogue committee was appointed last year to weigh reforms proposed by the king only four of its  members were women         that was a weakness taher masri the committees chairman and president of the senate said in an interview in july however we considered ourselves on the side of women and their cause         some jordanians think the absence of women in government positions since political upheaval began in the region over a year ago is a step backwards others say that their absence in highprofile political posts is an understandable result of the way women are traditionally viewed in politics jordans conservative culture the argument goes makes it difficult for women to play prominent political roles         last autumn many women and human rights advocates criticized the committee drafting a new constitution for not including the concept of gender equality in a sentence in the document that barred discrimination on grounds of race language or religion         we demanded that the word gender be included in article  because based on this other laws that discriminate against women could be amended as well said ms abu elbeh         it was a big loss for jordanian women but we discovered that even in parliament itself there wasnt much support for this among both men and even some women because there is a trend of conservatism  she said         the lower house of parliament is elected while the upper house is appointed by the king who also appoints and dismisses prime ministers and cabinets         even some government insiders acknowledge that women have been left out         the political environment here has not been friendly to those who are socially secluded including women said malek twal head of the ministry of political development         six speakers including mr twal at a panel last month in amman that was called equality so when spoke about the challenges that continue to hold women back politically         the discussion pinpointed one shift since the arab spring that has not helped women  a rise in religious conservatism        '

S'the controversy over the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya and the obama administrations response to it are being dumbed down and overblown dumbed down because the focus is on word choice rather than substantive criticism of the administrations handling of the incident overblown because the administrations critics are trying to make an argument that the facts dont support         that this is happening is not surprising given the nature of us politics especially during a presidential election campaign but it has the unfortunate consequence of obscuring the actual significance of the attack         in the weeks since the attack the presidents critics have focused their attention on his choice of words to characterize the incident in particular whether or not he called it an act of terror there is a valid substantive basis for questioning whether the president and his administration intentionally avoided characterizing the attack as a terrorist act         after all the administration has invested a great amount of political capital in the electoral value of having won the war on terror if its reluctance to explicitly acknowledge the premeditated nature of the attack on the benghazi consulate was intentional and meant to preserve this campaign plank it amounts to willful dishonesty a punishable offense for any government official if it was unintentional then there are some other valid questions to be asked about the administrations crisis response and risk preparedness procedures         but those targeting the president for his choice of words do so with a larger objective in mind to implicitly call into question his administrations record on countering global terrorist networks here they are pursuing a red herring         obama has been ruthless  some would say too ruthless  in pursuing an invisible war against al qaeda and its affiliates as a result of a withering campaign of us drone strikes al qaeda central is largely a shell of its former self in afghanistanpakistan and its local affiliate in yemen is suffering in somalia al shabab is on the run  the first good news to come out of that troubled state in decades         what has emerged in the past two years however is a troubling new vector of islamist radicalism in libya and the sahel where al qaeda in the islamic maghreb and islamist tuareg militants have taken advantage of the regions large expanses of undergoverned territory to establish themselves         first it is important to emphasize that while all of the factors feeding this growing threat have been exacerbated by the arab spring and the nato intervention in libya none of them were created by either event         the obama administration is not responsible either for islamist militancy in eastern libya which was already a major source of foreign fighters in usoccupied iraq nor in northern mali where tuareg nationalism had already been the cause of numerous armed uprisings         it bears noting that many of the groups active in the region are also engaged in lucrative transnational criminal activities such as kidnapping and smuggling their extremist rhetoric is at times opportunistic and must be understood in the context of their business interests         second the insistence on calling the attack on benghazi an act of terror might be counterproductive in the sense that it could obscure a turning point in the long war the united states has been waging in the region for the past decade         in particular it is necessary to distinguish between militancy and terrorism  something americans have no problem doing in regard to colombian paramilitary groups for example but seem to find more difficult when it comes to radical islamists         not every guy with a gun and a grievance is a terrorist those responsible for the attack on the us consulate in benghazi were operating locally for largely local objectives and they threaten neither americans nor america so while americans should feel outraged by the attack it would be absurd for them to feel terrorized by it        '

S'washington  even as susan e rice took to the sunday talk shows last month to describe the obama administrations assessment of the sept  attack on the american diplomatic mission in benghazi libya intelligence analysts suspected that the explanation was outdated         ms rice the united states ambassador to the united nations has said that the judgments she offered on the five talk shows on sept  came from talking points prepared by the cia which reckoned that the attack that killed ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans had resulted from a spontaneous mob that was angry about an antiislamic video that had set off protests elsewhere that assessment described to ms rice in briefings the day before her television appearances was based on intercepted communications informants tips and libyan press reports officials said         later that sunday though american intelligence analysts were already sifting through new field reports that seemed to contradict the initial assessment it would be several days however before the intelligence agencies changed their formal assessment based on those new reports and informed administration officials about the change intelligence officials say such a lag is typical of the everchanging process of piecing together shards of information into a coherent picture fit for officials public statements         gov mitt romney and congressional republicans have sharply criticized ms rices comments and the administrations shifting public positions on the cause of the attack criticisms that mr romney will probably reprise in the final presidential debate on monday night         on sunday congressional republicans cited the administrations response to the attack as symptomatic of larger leadership failings this is going to be a case study studied for years of a breakdown of national security at every level failed presidential leadership  senior members of the obama administration failed miserably senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina said on fox news sunday         the gap between the talking points prepared for ms rice and the contemporaneous field reports that seemed to paint a much different picture illustrates how the process of turning raw field reports which officials say need to be vetted and assessed into polished intelligence assessments can take days long enough to make them outdated by the time senior american officials utter them         intelligence officials alarmed that their work has been turned into a political football defend their approach noting that senior administration officials receive daily briefings that reflect the consensus of the nations array of intelligence agencies but can also dip into the fastmoving stream of field reports with the caveat that that information is incomplete and may be flat wrong         a demand for an explanation that is quick definite and unchanging reflects a nave expectation  or in the present case irresponsible politicking james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence said at an intelligence symposium on oct          the associated press reported friday for instance that within  hours of the attack the cias station chief in tripoli libya emailed headquarters that witnesses said the assault was mounted by heavily armed militants but intelligence officials said sunday that one report was not enough to establish the attacks nature         according to interviews with a halfdozen american officials including policy makers and intelligence officials here is a rough chronology of what happened some details of which the wall street journal reported friday         on sept  ms rice and other cabinetlevel officials were told about the assessment that there had been protests at the diplomatic mission in benghazi         the first briefing was exactly as one would expect in the early aftermath of a crisis an american intelligence official said speaking on condition of anonymity because of the continuing fbi investigation of the assault it carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information relying on the best analysis available at the time briefers said extremists were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous        '

VQatar\u2019s Emir Visits Gaza, Pledging $400 Million to Hamas
p986
sg6
S'jerusalem  the emir of qatar on tuesday became the first head of state to visit the gaza strip since hamas took full control of it in  the latest step in an ambitious campaign by the tiny persian gulf nation to leverage its outsize pocketbook in support of islamists across the region  and one that threatened to widen the rift between rival palestinian factions         the emir sheik hamad bin khalifa althani pledged  million to build two housing complexes rehabilitate three main roads and create a prosthetic center among other projects a transformational infusion of cash at a time when foreign aid to the palestinian territories has been in free fall the sheik his wife and the qatari prime minister led a large delegation that entered gaza from egypt and sped in a convoy of black mercedesbenzes and armored toyotas through streets lined with people waving qatari and palestinian flags         today you are a big guest great guest declaring officially the breaking of the political and economic siege that was imposed on gaza ismail haniya the hamas prime minister told the emir and his cohort as they sat on sofas in a white shed in the southern town of khan yunis where they plan to erect  apartments today we declare the victory on this siege through this blessed historic visit         in the west bank allies of mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority who has struggled to preserve his own legitimacy warned that the visit set a dangerous precedent of arab leaders embracing mr haniya as a head of state and thus cleaving the palestinian people and territory in two we call on the qatari prince or his representative to visit the west bank too blared a headline on an editorial in the leading newspaper al quds   the visit signaled just how much the region had changed for hamas since the advent of the arab spring where egypt under president hosni mubarak once allied with saudi arabia to squeeze hamas by keeping the border largely closed egypt under a new islamist president mohamed morsi opened the crossing to allow the qatari ruler through but the visit also reflected the unique foreign policy that has allowed qatar to straddle competing worlds bankrolling political movements like hamas deemed a terrorist organization by the united states while maintaining strong links to washington         sheik hamad who has ruled qatar since  has gradually transformed the tiny nation into a regional powerhouse relying on its immense wealth to extend its influence that has been especially true in the past two years as qatar has played decisive roles in the revolutions in libya and yemen and the isolation of the syrian government         qatar allied with the west in helping oust col muammar elqaddafi in libya while financing islamists on the ground in egypt it has close ties to the muslim brotherhood in syria it provides cash and weapons to islamists battling president bashar alassad and at the same time it hosts a large united states military base that affords it protection in a volatile neighborhood         qatar is a secure little kernel with huge resources that has chosen to use those resources in foreign policy said paul salem director of the beirutbased carnegie middle east center they have no constraints they can take any position anytime anywhere         but eight months after doha the qatari capital hosted the signing of a reconciliation agreement between the hamas leadership and mr abbas the deal has not come to fruition in the form of national elections on tuesday the emirs visit drove a deeper wedge between hamas and fatah the party of mr abbas and raised alarm in israel         hamas has refused to reject violence or recognize israel which also considers it a terrorist organization and has struggled lately to control more militant islamist groups within gaza since the uprising began in syria in march  hamas has closed its offices in syria its primary patron and tried to establish a close and direct connection to mr morsi of egypt who was a leader within the muslim brotherhood before his election         yigal palmor a spokesman for israels foreign ministry declared that the emir had thrown peace under the bus noting that his visit came a few hours after an israeli soldier was severely wounded when a bomb exploded along the border with gaza southern israel has faced what he described as a steady drizzle of rockets in the last few weeks         it helps hamas entrench themselves in gaza not to yield one inch to the pa and enhancing the division and the reality of two de facto states mr palmor said most of the money that hes pouring in gaza will go to hamas pockets directly or indirectly you think that will encourage them to hold national elections         the qatari projects dwarf the roughly  million in foreign aid that analysts estimate gaza receives annually they come as international donations to the palestinian authority have nosedived from a peak of  billion in  to less than  million this year according to a world bank report the shift is part of a broader financial crisis that has caused the delayed or partial payment of government salaries three months running the focus of violent street protests in the west bank last month         nathan thrall an analyst with the international crisis group said a critical question was whether rumored visits to gaza by other regional heads of state would follow qatars he said that cairos role in brokering the visit was an important signal in the evolving relationship between gaza and egypt and that hamas was hoping it would help reverse the socalled west bankfirst model of attempting to promote prosperity in ramallah and austerity in gaza         the message that hamas wishes to convey is we are the future the pa is disintegrating  he said the argument hamas is hoping to make is that this is the beginning of a sort of gazafirst model arabs ignoring a failing pa and supporting gaza with sums of money that europeans even if they wanted to couldnt match         the sixhour visit ended with a large rally at the islamic university in gaza city where the emir and his wife received honorary doctorates         speaking at the university he called on palestinian leaders to repair their rift which he said was more painful than the israeli aggression and left them without peace negotiations or a resistance and liberation strategy        '

S'a letter signed by  leaders of christian churches that calls for congress to reconsider giving aid to israel because of accusations of human rights violations has outraged jewish leaders and threatened to derail longstanding efforts to build interfaith relations         the christian leaders say their intention was to put the palestinian plight and the stalled peace negotiations back in the spotlight at a time when all of the attention to middle east policy seems to be focused on syria the arab spring and the iranian nuclear threat         we asked congress to treat israel like it would any other country said the rev gradye parsons the top official of the presbyterian church usa to make sure our military aid is going to a country espousing the values we would as americans  that its not being used to continually violate the human rights of other people         the jewish leaders responded to the action as a momentous betrayal and announced their withdrawal from a regularly scheduled jewishchristian dialogue meeting planned for monday in a statement the jewish leaders called the letter by the christian groups a step too far and an indication of the vicious antizionism that has gone virtually unchecked in several of these denominations         something is deeply broken badly broken said ethan felson vice president and general counsel of the jewish council for public affairs an umbrella group that helped to convene the meeting were certainly not getting anywhere now         the jewish groups have called for the christian churches to send their top officials to a summit meeting to discuss the situation an invitation the christian leaders say they are considering         the christian leaders involved are mostly from the historically mainline protestant churches many of these same churches have taken up contentious resolutions to divest their stock holdings from companies that sell military and security equipment to israel meanwhile successive israeli governments have found stalwart support in conservative evangelical american churches         the breach is all the more bitter because it involves jewish groups known for cultivating strong interfaith relationships including the reform and conservative movements the american jewish committee and bnai brith international         the controversy began on oct  when the christian groups sent a letter urging congress to hold hearings into whether israel was violating the terms for foreign aid recipients the christian leaders wrote that they had witnessed widespread israeli human rights violations against the palestinians including killing of civilians home demolitions and forced displacement and restrictions on palestinian movement         the letter said that israel had continued expanding settlements in the west bank and east jerusalem despite american calls to stop claiming territory that under international law and united states policy should belong to a future palestinian state         the signers besides the presbyterians included leaders of the evangelical lutheran church in america the united methodist church the national council of churches the united church of christ the christian church disciples of christ the american friends service committee a quaker agency and the mennonite central committee two catholic leaders also signed one with the conference of major superiors of men an umbrella group of mens religious orders         the christian leaders letter acknowledged that both israelis and palestinians had suffered and that both sides bore responsibility but it called for an investigation into only israels activities         the jewish leaders said such an approach was a double standard the palestinian authority also receives foreign aid from the united states and has also been accused of rights violations they said         wheres the letter to congress about syria which is massacring its own people said rabbi steven wernick the chief executive of the united synagogue of conservative judaism when israel is the only one that is called to account thats when it becomes problematic         several christian leaders responded in interviews that the letter was focused only on israel because it is the largest recipient of american foreign aid and because the aid flows to israel without conditions or accountability         humanitarian aid to the palestinian authority was suspended last year because of violations and congress is reevaluating aid to egypt noted peter makari the executive for the middle east and europe in global ministries of the united church of christ and the christian church disciples of christ who helped write the letter         the need to hold israel as accountable as other countries in the region is important he said         antonios s kireopoulos the director of interfaith relations and associate general secretary of the national council of churches said its a dramatic step but its out of frustration that the situation in israelpalestine is not moving along constructively         the jewish leaders were shocked not just by the content of the letter but also by the fact that the christian leaders had not given them any warning both sides have been participating for eight years in a christianjewish round table designed to heal wounds over the israelipalestinian conflict it was mondays meeting that the jewish leaders canceled         what were seeing is people in the mainstream jewish community doves and hawks who are really feeling at a point of exhaustion said mr felson of the jewish council for public affairs        '

S'washington  president hosni mubarak did not even wait for president obamas words to be translated before he shot back         you dont understand this part of the world the egyptian leader broke in youre young         mr obama during a tense telephone call the evening of feb   had just told mr mubarak that his speech broadcast to hundreds of thousands of protesters in tahrir square in cairo had not gone far enough mr mubarak had to step down the president said         minutes later a grim mr obama appeared before hastily summoned cameras in the grand foyer of the white house the end of mr mubaraks year rule mr obama said must begin now with those words mr obama upended three decades of american relations with its most stalwart ally in the arab world putting the weight of the united states squarely on the side of the arab street         it was a risky move by the american president flying in the face of advice from elders on his staff at the state department and at the pentagon who had spent decades nursing the autocratic  but staunchly proamerican  egyptian government         nineteen months later mr obama was at the state department consoling some of the very officials he had overruled antiamerican protests broke out in egypt and libya in libya they led to the deaths of four americans including the united states ambassador to libya j christopher stevens a new egyptian government run by the muslim brotherhood was dragging its feet about condemning attacks on the american embassy in cairo         television sets in the united states were filled with images of arabs angry over an americanmade video that ridiculed the prophet muhammad burning american flags and even effigies of mr obama         speaking privately to grieving state department workers the president tried to make sense of the unfolding events he talked about how he had been a child abroad taught to appreciate american diplomats who risked their lives for their country that work and the outreach to the arab world he said must continue even in the face of mob violence that called into question what the united states can accomplish in a turbulent region         in many ways mr obamas remarks at the state department two weeks ago  and the ones he will make before the general assembly on tuesday morning when he addresses the antiamerican protests  reflected hard lessons the president had learned over almost two years of political turmoil in the arab world bold words and support for democratic aspirations are not enough to engender good will in this region especially not when hampered by americas own national security interests         in fact mr obamas staunch defense of democracy protesters in egypt last year soon drew him into an upheaval that would test his judgment his nerve and his diplomatic skill even as the uprisings spread to libya yemen bahrain and syria the presidents sympathy for the protesters infuriated americas allies in the conservative and oilrich gulf states in midmarch the saudis moved decisively to crush the democracy protests in bahrain sending a convoy of tanks and heavy artillery across the mile king fahd causeway between the two countries         that blunt show of force confronted mr obama with the limits of his ability or his willingness to midwife democratic change despite a global outcry over the shooting and teargassing of peaceful protesters in bahrain the president largely turned a blind eye his realism and reluctance to be drawn into foreign quagmires has held sway ever since notably in syria where many critics continue to call for a more aggressive american response to the brutality of bashar alassads rule         mr obamas journey from cairo to the causeway took just  days in part it reflected the different circumstances in the countries where protests broke out despite their common origins and slogans but his handling of the uprisings also demonstrates the gap between the two poles of his political persona his sense of himself as a historic bridgebuilder who could redeem americas image abroad and his more cautious adherence to longterm american interests in security and cheap oil        '

S'it is an amazing stroke of luck that myanmar has managed to produce both a nelson mandela and a mikhail gorbachev yes such analogies are generally glib but in this case they are apt in daw aung san suu kyi the burmese have an opposition figure who traded personal freedom for moral authority and now has begun to spend that moral authority wisely less celebrated but equally fortunate they have in u thein sein a president who though he emerged from a brutal regime and a stacked election has embraced political and economic reform with a conviction that has stunned the most skeptical foes of the old order         the country faces immense challenges including corruption and cronyism bitter ethnicreligious conflicts and the potential disappointment if the euphoria passes and the impoverished millions are still impoverished until myanmar writes a new constitution the old guard still has the right to resume the absolute power it held for almost half a century         but this beautiful longsuffering land wedged between china and india finally has the makings of a transformation that deserves americas enthusiastic help president obama and secretary of state hillary rodham clinton clearly realize this as do most of the advocates who have campaigned for this moment americas ability to assist at the birth of a new free myanmar though still faces critics so invested in the cause that they are reluctant to take yes for an answer         i heard both aung san suu kyi and thein sein last week as they passed through new york you will find conversations with both posted on my blog they are at first blush improbable partners aung san suu kyi who spent  years under house arrest radiates confidence intelligence and charm the daughter of burmas founding general oxfordeducated well traveled multilingual a nobel laureate she seems born to lead and listening to her makes you a little embarrassed for the level of our own current political discourse         thein sein is a cautious uncharismatic man with a combover and wirerimmed spectacles he speaks through a translator repeating wellrehearsed lines         he grew up the son of poor farmers in a village in the irrawaddy river delta he came up through the military with a reputation as an army bureaucrat rather than a combat officer as a sober strategic thinker and as the rare honest man in a junta of kleptocrats he told me he didnt travel outside myanmar until he was a colonel in his mids         yet these two share in addition to an essential pragmatism an awareness that dictatorship has led their country close to utter ruin and so far the spine to stand up to the less forwardthinking members of their respective parties both seem impressively aware that consolidating burmas promise depends not on the personal qualities of a few reformist leaders but on restoring the institutions and culture of democracy         the most remarkable thing about aung san suu kyi is how quickly she has learned the difference between being an icon and being a politician not all dissidents can see beyond injustice to the virtue of compromise and those who do often spend as much time dueling with their allies as with their oppressors nelson mandela did not rescue south africa by spending  years in prison he rescued south africa by spending  years in prison and then negotiating a powersharing deal with the people who sent him there to the dismay of some of his more unyielding colleagues aung san suu kyi month by month grows more sophisticated at using her stature without spooking the old guard she brought her party into elections even though she was allowed to contest only a fraction of the parliamentary seats she has lent some of her credibility to thein seins administration endorsing an end to sanctions she speaks of the need to make the military feel secure against retribution no war crimes tribunal no confiscation of property when asked what could imperil her countrys resurrection she includes high on the list of dangers the militants within her own ranks she is an entirely plausible next president in  when thein sein says he hopes to retire depending he adds on the wishes of the people         thein sein has been understandably overshadowed by aung san suu kyis heroic celebrity but he has managed a surprisingly swift mercifully bloodless topdown reformation he released hundreds of political prisoners relaxed censorship initiated ceasefires with several ethnic rebel groups persuaded the opposition to participate in elections built a circle of comparatively candid and savvy advisers and reached out to the west aung san suu kyi says as margaret thatcher said of gorbachev that this is a man we can do business with        '

p1314
sg6
S'london  the muslim world cannot have it both ways it cannot place islam at the center of political life  and in extreme cases political violence  while at the same time declaring that the religion is offlimits to contestation and ridicule         islam is one of the worlds three great monotheistic religions of them it is the youngest by several centuries and perhaps for that reason the most fervid and turbulent it is also in diverse forms a political movement reference and inspiration         politics is a roughandtumble game if the emergent islamic parties of nations in transition  like the muslim brotherhood in egypt and ennahda in tunisia  are to honor the terms of democratic governance they will have to concede that they have no monopoly on truth that the prescriptions of islam are malleable and debatable and that significant currents in their societies have different convictions and even faiths         the past couple of weeks have been discouraging nobody expects a us standard of freedom of speech to be adopted  or even fully understood  in these societies they will set their own political and cultural frameworks inspired by a still fervent desire to escape from despotism whether secular or theocratic and by the central place of faith         but the failure in tunisia libya and egypt to control violent mobs of salafis enraged by mockery in america and europe of islam and the prophet muhammad suggests an unacceptable ambivalence the rule of law here on earth must override divine indignation         the world has tried islamic republics it found them oxymoronic as iran illustrates they dont work republican institutions shaped by the wishes of men and women fall victim to the islamic superstructure supposedly shaped by god         the great challenge of the arab spring is to prove that as in turkey parties of islamic inspiration can embrace a modern pluralism and so usher their societies from a culture of grievance and victimhood to one of creativity and agency         just how deep the grievances remain in the arab world  over loss of power economic stagnation colonial intrusion western wars and israel  has been clear in the latest eruption change will be slow         but it is coming these societies will not return to tyranny the west has an overwhelming strategic interest in supporting transitions that offer the youth of the arab world opportunity egypt now dwarfs afghanistan in its importance to fighting islamic extremism         but the west will not do so by compromising its own values the porngrade american movie that started the unrest was pitiful the murderous violence that followed from cairo to benghazi was criminal charlie hebdo the french satirical newspaper then had a strong editorial case for mocking the religious fundamentalism that produced the killing it chose to do so through caricatures of muhammad         grard biard the editor in chief of charlie hebdo put the case well were a newspaper that respects french law now if theres a law that is different in kabul or riyadh were not going to bother ourselves with respecting it alluding to all the violence biard asked are we supposed to not do that news         he is right there are too many hypocrisies in islam  deploring attacks on it while often casting scorn on judaism and christianity claiming the mantle of peace while inspiring violence  for it to expect to be spared the cartoonists arrows         the video insulting muhammad reflected the visceral islamophobia of its authors charlie hebdo was driven by a different agenda the refusal to be cowed by a spate of atavistic islamist religious violence         still i defend the right of the videos authors even if i loathe what they produced the us supreme court in its  brandenburg v ohio decision overturned the conviction of a ku klux klan leader who had menaced political officials with violence saying that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force as glenn greenwald wrote in the guardian obviously if the state cannot suppress speech even where it explicitly advocates violence then it cannot suppress a video on the ground that it implicitly incites violence         the rich maelstrom of ideas in the united states is inextricably tied to this fundamental freedom it cannot be compromised         as for the new leaders of egypt libya and tunisia and the great mass of moderate muslims they might recall the words of the late grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri protesting the stolen iranian election of   an example of gods supposed will imposed over the will of the people         a characteristic of a strong and legitimate government  islamic or not  is that it is capable of respecting all opinions whether they support it or oppose it this is necessary for any political system in order to embrace all social classes and encourage them to participate in the affairs of their nation and not dismiss and repulse them         montazeri fell out with ayatollah khomeini because his iranian theocracy was incapable of respecting all opinions decades on in this arab awakening that challenge remains for political islam        '

S'cairo  stepping from the cloud of tear gas in front of the american embassy here khaled ali repeated the urgent question that he said justified last weeks violent protests at united states outposts around the muslim world         we never insult any prophet  not moses not jesus  so why cant we demand that muhammad be respected mr ali a yearold textile worker said holding up a handwritten sign in english that read shut up america obama is the president so he should have to apologize         when the protests against an americanmade online video mocking the prophet muhammad exploded in about  countries the source of the rage was more than just religious sensitivity political demagogy or resentment of washington protesters and their sympathizers here said it was also a demand that many of them described with the word freedom although in a context very different from the terms use in the individualistic west the right of a community whether muslim christian or jewish to be free from grave insult to its identity and values         that demand in turn was swept up in the colliding crosscurrents of regional politics from one side came the gale of anger at americas decadeold war against terrorism which in the eyes of many muslims in the region often looks like a war against them and from the other the new winds blowing through the region in the aftermath of the arab spring which to many here means most of all a right to demand respect for the popular will         we want these countries to understand that they need to take into consideration the people and not just the governments said ismail mohamed  a religious scholar who once was an imam in germany we dont think that depictions of the prophets are freedom of expression we think it is an offense against our rights he said adding the west has to understand the ideology of the people         even during the protests some stone throwers stressed that the clash was not muslim against christian instead they suggested that the traditionalism of people of both faiths in the region conflicted with western individualism and secularism         youssef sidhom the editor of the coptic christian newspaper watani said he objected only to the violence of the protests         mr sidhom approvingly recalled the uproar among egyptian christians that greeted the  film the da vinci code which was seen as an affront to aspects of traditional christianity and the persona of jesus egypt jordan lebanon and other arab countries banned both the film and the book on which it was based and in egypt where insulting any of the three abrahamic religions is a crime the police even arrested the head of a local film company for importing  copies of the dvd according to news reports         this reaction is expected mr sidhom said of last weeks protests and if it had stayed peaceful i would have said i supported it and understood         in a context where insults to religion are crimes and the state has tightly controlled almost all media many in egypt like other arab countries sometimes find it hard to understand that the american government feels limited by its free speech rules from silencing even the most noxious religious bigot         in his statement after protesters breached the walls of the united states embassy last tuesday the spiritual leader of the egypts mainstream islamist group the muslim brotherhood declared that the west had imposed laws against those who deny or express dissident views on the holocaust or question the number of jews killed by hitler a topic which is purely historical not a sacred doctrine         in fact denying the holocaust is also protected as free speech in the united states although it is prohibited in germany and a few other european countries but the belief that it is illegal in the united states is widespread in egypt and the brotherhoods spiritual leader mohamed badie called for the criminalizing of assaults on the sanctities of all heavenly religions        '

VSome Mulsims in Egypt say the rage over an American-made online video mocking the Prophet Muhammad is more than just religious sensitivity, political demagogy or resentment of Washington; say it is about the freedom and right of a community, whether Muslim, Christian or Jewish, to be free from grave insult to its identity and values.

VSyria Turmoil Exposes Rifts Among Arab Intellectuals

S'amman jordan  when the arab spring reached jordan last year a newspaper columnist muwafaq mahadin was one of the first to march with protesters demanding reforms in his country         he also backed syrian demonstrators who began taking to the streets in march  but a few months later he made an aboutface aligning with the regime of president bashar alassad like many other arab intellectuals he says he did so out of fear for the future of the region         this is a corrupt undemocratic police state but what is going on is not a war in syria but a battle by outside players for syria he said in an august interview in an office at the writers union building in amman         mr mahadin a prominent opposition figure who writes for the independent jordanian daily alarab alyawm has extensive prodemocracy credentials he was arrested several times for his political views and was even forced to flee the country for a decade living in exile between beirut and damascus         these days some revile him as a conspiracy theorist while others call him courageous regardless his columns fuel heated debate among jordanian intellectuals         over the years he spent in damascus mr mahadin built strong ties with the syrian opposition he says the revolt in syria was initially a spontaneous uprising of the street but was later hijacked by international powers         mr mahadin is just one of a number of leftist antiimperialist intellectuals who believe that the syrian rebellion is being led by islamists aligned with the west manipulated by ggulf states including qatar and saudi arabia on the behalf of the united states and israel in order to gain dominance in the region         a group of  influential figures have signed an open letter in the press demanding that jordan stand with syria in the face of a global conspiracy         we particularly appreciate the perseverance of the syrian leadership in keeping the pace of reforms and adhering to dialogue despite mounting terrorist acts against syria  despite the inflammatory media campaigns by qatar saudi arabia and the west and despite interventions that are contrary to international law  evidenced by the smuggling of money and various weapons into syria the statement read         mr mahadin says that the conflict taking place in syria echoes the cold war with rebels being funded and armed  just as islamist mujahedin fighters were  by the west to fight soviet control of afghanistan during the s         i have felt dutybound to hold the syrian regime responsible for its role in crisis especially when i consider the way the regime has taken the country to a point where it has ended up with streets and walls covered in blood mr mahadin wrote in a july column in alarab alyawm yet every time i felt the need to write about that the voice of the conspiracy and the fact of the foreign intervention has overpowered this desire and need         mr mahadin traveled to syria last year on a special visit to express solidarity with the assad regime and wrote a series of columns accusing the international media of lying about what was transpiring there         in august  he disputed reports on satellite channels that homs was surrounded by tanks saying that he passed through the city without seeing a single tank that same year he offended a group of jordanian artists protesting in amman by concluding a speech with the rallying cry long live bashar         according to franois burgat a senior research fellow specializing in middle eastern politics at the french national center for scientific research mr mahadins analysis of the syrian conflict understates the strength of the popular revolt while overstating international influences         in this view he said the armed opposition is reduced to islamist groups of mercenaries recruited or funded by the oil monarchies at the service of their western allies these secular marxists dislike the fact that the forces of resistance recruit among islamists         mr burgat believes that leftist intellectuals who support mr assad are giving in to an old arab temptation of preferring to retain an authoritarian regime rather than risking increasing islamist influence in a new government as has happened in egypt libya and tunisia         these conflicting viewpoints on syria have buffeted the prodemocracy efforts in jordan creating a division within the opposition movement there according to lamis andoni another prominent jordanian columnist who is of palestinian descent         ms andoni says that while there are legitimate concerns over the impact on the wider region should the assad government fall this cannot justify support for a regime that kills civilians         many people have supported the syrian regime because of its important role in the region in countering israeli expansionism she said         but the moment the syrian people rose the claim to support it because it is a resistance state is no longer valid it does not give the state the right to kill its own people         mr mahadin is not alone joseph massad who teaches modern arab politics and intellectual history at columbia university in new york argues that throwing out a dictator with the help of foreign allies is always a bad idea         ziad majed a professor of middle east studies at the american university of paris says that it is legitimate for syrians to aspire to end a regime that has governed brutally for more than four decades         assad should depart and a transition should take place mr majed said discussions over international and regional politics can be legitimate and necessary but they can also be no more than an excuse to defend a despotic regime and to close ones eyes in front of an ongoing massacre         meanwhile syrian refugees who have fled the fighting in their homeland want whatever help they can get when foreign minister laurent fabius of france visited al zaatari camp in northern jordan at the syrian border in midaugust refugees held a protest asking france to come to the rescue of syrian civilians         its nice to know you stand with us but its not stopping the massacre shouted a refugee during the french officials visit we dont want humanitarian help we want rocket launchers and weapons        '

VDUBAI -- When Glowork.net , a recruitment site for women in Saudi Arabia , started up last year, its founder, Khalid al-Khudairi, was hit with a deluge of threatening e-mail and phone calls warning him to shut down because he was violating cultural norms. Now the Saudi Ministry of Labor has asked him to help encourage women to find work. The government turned to the start-up because many of those seeking jobs in the kingdom are women.

S'sana yemen  deadly outrage in the arab world over an americanmade video insulting islams founder spread to at least half a dozen places across the middle east on thursday and threatened to draw in afghanistan two days after assailants in libya killed four american diplomatic personnel including the ambassador and caused a foreign policy political clash in the united states         the worst of the violence was in yemen where at least five yemenis were killed as hundreds of protesters stormed the american embassy and were repulsed by yemeni security forces the embassys entire staff sensitive to impending danger had been safely evacuated hours beforehand and yemeni leaders apologized to president obama for the mayhem         but some assailants were able to burn cars plunder office equipment including computers burn an american flag and hoist their own proclaiming fealty to islam witnesses and yemeni officials said at least  american embassy vehicles had been damaged or destroyed by fire         by nightfall witnesses said smoke was still rising from the embassy compound in the eastern part of the capital sana as protesters still raged from a perimeter  yards away         in egypt where the antiamerican anger began on tuesday over the previously obscure video protesters scuffled with police officers firing tear gas and news agencies reported that dozens of people were hurt demonstrations were also reported outside united states diplomatic facilities in morocco sudan and tunisia  where the police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds  and an antiamerican protest was held in the palestinian enclave of gaza         in iran where nearly all large protests must get government approval witnesses and news reports said  iranians screaming death to america converged outside the swiss embassy which handles american diplomatic interests and were restrained by hundreds of police officers         the authorities in afghanistan where deadly violence has chronically flared over perceived insults to islam scrambled to minimize the possibility that the offending video which portrays the prophet muhammad as a perverted buffoon could be viewed on the internet and provoke new protests afghanistan officials said they had pressed for an indefinite suspension of access to youtube where the video promoted by a shadowy mlange of rightwing christians in the united states had received more than  million hits by thursday afternoon         in washington secretary of state hillary rodham clinton delivered a strongly worded denunciation of the video in what her spokeswoman later said was an effort to quash the mistaken belief in some parts of the arab world that the united states government somehow had sponsored or condoned it to us to me personally this video is disgusting and reprehensible mrs clinton said at a briefing with moroccos foreign minister at the state department it appears to have a deeply cynical purpose to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage         she went on to say that the constitution did not allow the united states to prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day and could not if it tried given modern technology         there are of course different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and free expression but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in response to speech is not acceptable she said we all  whether we are leaders in government leaders in civil society or religious leaders  must draw the line at violence and any responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line         the new violence came as news reports from libya said the authorities there had made at least four arrests in connection with the killings of the four americans in the mayhem that engulfed the american consulate in the eastern city of benghazi on tuesday night fbi agents were also investigating the killings a law enforcement official in washington said         in addition the third of those four victims was positively identified by his family as glen doherty  of winchester mass a former navy seal working as a security officer mr doherty died along with the american ambassador to libya j christopher stevens and another diplomat sean smith the fourth american has not yet been publicly identified        '

S'on a backpacking trip once i slipped on a steep ice sheet and began sliding uncontrollably toward the edge of a cliff overhanging an icy river         luckily my son pulled me to safety with his trekking pole am i better off now than i was when i was sliding toward the abyss duh         thats a useful starting point in any assessment of president obama in many ways his first term has been disappointing the economy remains weak housing is a mess and for a man with a silver tongue he has been a wretched communicator then again were incomparably better off than when we were tumbling toward another great depression         with that in mind let me offer a firstterm report card for obama         economy b in january  the month obama took office america lost  jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics that was the biggest monthly loss in six decades and many feared a complete banking collapse         obama rescued the banking and auto sectors independent estimates suggest his stimulus may have saved or created more than three million jobs and an anemic recovery began the economist magazine conservative by nature assessed his handling of the crisis and recession were impressive         however the administration blew it with overoptimistic comments that shredded its credibility it was also too generous to banks in negotiating their rescues and it often seemed oblivious to resentment of crony capitalism and to broader issues of economic inequality         worst of all obama dropped the ball on housing betraying struggling homeowners far fewer mortgages have been modified or refinanced under administration programs than expected and some americans have lost their homes as a result exacerbating inequality underwater mortgages have been a drag on the entire economy         education a democrats traditionally favored every antipoverty program except the one that might be most effective reform of innercity schools finally that has changed under obama and his education secretary arne duncan         they have pilfered republican ideas and repositioned the democratic party to make school reform a top priority they are willing to offend teachers unions but recognize the practical need to work closely with them obamas race to the top initiative bribed states to devise their own school reforms a costeffective way to achieve nationwide change         obama has pushed pell grants to make college more affordable and has promoted investments in community colleges unfortunately he hasnt done quite as well on early childhood education which should be every bit as much a priority as tertiary education         other domestic issues b obama gets credit for ending dont ask dont tell and allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in our armed forces he took a step toward immigration reform by allowing certain young immigrants to obtain work permits above all he achieved health care reform  a goal of presidents for more than halfacentury         foreign policy b obama brought troops home from iraq and took out osama bin laden he was superb in providing bold leadership in libya at a time when so many american experts were saying that the intervention wouldnt work his unusual move in picking hillary clinton to be secretary of state has paid off brilliantly and its great to see the state department pursuing a stcentury agenda that includes girls education as well as say arms control         then again obamas surge in afghanistan has accomplished little except a huge increase in blood and treasure spilled there in pakistan a more important country than either iraq or afghanistan obama has stumbled         obamas peace effort in the middle east collapsed partly because of administration infighting and ineptitude and he often seemed behind the curve during the arab spring he has been purely reactive in syria and hypocritical in the case of brutal repression by our ally bahrain         a bright spot is obamas international coalition to squeeze iran while restraining jingoists in israel from dragging us into a war there one way or another i fear that we may well end up at war with iran in the next four years but my sense is that that is less likely in an obama administration than in a romney administration         communication f a presidents central job is not policy wonk but national team captain there obama failed us he has not made the case for his policies nor has he comforted the nation as franklin roosevelt did in his fireside chats presidents always campaign in poetry and govern in prose but the prose doesnt have to be chilly latin         in short we have a mixed picture not as triumphant as the democrats in charlotte nc claim but still much better than many americans give obama credit for a pithy summary comes from vice president joe biden osama bin laden is dead and general motors is alive thats not a bad reelection bumper sticker        '

S'cairo  staking out a new leadership role for egypt in the shaken landscape of the arab uprisings president mohamed morsi is reaching out to iran and other regional powers in an initiative to halt the escalating violence in syria         the initiative centered on a committee of four that also includes turkey and saudi arabia is the first foreign policy priority taken up by mr morsi the islamist who became egypts first elected leader two months ago         following failed efforts by the arab league and united nations to stop syrias descent into civil war mr morsis plan sets a notably assertive and independent course for an egypt that is still sorting out its own transition         we are determined to make this committee of four successful yasser ali a spokesman for mr morsi said sunday he called the syria crisis the main issue in the egyptian presidents coming visit to china which along with iran and russia has been a pillar of support for president bashar alassad of syria as his military assaulted opposition strongholds part of the mission is in china part of the mission is in russia and part of the mission is in iran mr ali said         coming at a moment of acute handwringing in the western capitals over how an islamist leadership of the largest arab state might alter the americanbacked regional order mr morsis focus bisects washingtons customary division of the region between westernfriendly states like egypt and saudi arabia on the one hand and iran on the other said emad shahin a political scientist at the american university in cairo         but although it involves collaboration with american rivals mr morsis specific initiative in particular also appears largely harmonious with the stated western objective of ending the syrian bloodshed         this is a reconfiguration of the regional and international politics of the region mr shahin said it will of course raise concerns in washington and tel aviv but i dont think this is a confrontational foreign policy it is a regional foreign policy tacking a regional problem through the capitals of the four most influential regional states without looking through the prism of washington and tel aviv         mr morsi has already called for mr assad to leave power and end the bloodshed in syria the escalating violence there has taken on all the trappings of a proxy war that threatens to destabilize the entire region with iran among the main backers of the assad government and saudi arabia and turkey among the main backers of the rebels         despite the failure of the arab league and united nations initiatives in syria some analysts argued that mr morsis regional approach may have a better chance to broker a peace in part because of the mutual hostility between iran and the west         obviously you need channels to the assad regime  people who are uncomfortable with the way things stand and would like to be seen as playing a more positive role said peter harling a syria researcher at the international crisis group speaking of iran and any effort to reach iran cant include the western camp it would be impossible if the us was involved         the egyptian foreign minister had already contacted his counterparts in the other three countries to arrange a preliminary meeting amr roshdy a foreign ministry spokesman said sunday mr morsi first proposed the initiative this month at a meeting of muslim nations in mecca and iranian state news media has reported that iranian officials have publicly lauded the plan         mr morsi is visiting tehran this week to attend a meeting of an organization of socalled nonaligned states but his spokesman mr ali said the visit would last only a few hours without any bilateral talks he also dismissed speculation that mr morsi planned to upgrade egypts relations with iran to full diplomatic relations the two countries cut off relations after the  iranian revolution and each keeps only a lesser diplomatic outpost in the others capital rather than a full embassy even though most other arab states  even saudi arabia irans longtime rival  have restored full ties         still mr ali called the inclusion of iran in the regional contact group on syria an opportunity because iran is an active party in the syrian issue        '

VLUANDA, Angola -- Angola's governing party was poised on Saturday to sweep parliamentary elections, winning a landslide victory that would ensure President Jos Eduardo dos Santos a five-year extension to his 33 years at the country's helm. Despite widespread discontent over inequality and corruption in Angola, Africa's second-largest oil-producing nation, Mr. dos Santos's party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, had won nearly three-quarters of the votes cast on Friday, according to the National Electoral Commission, which announced preliminary results Saturday afternoon based on the 60 percent of ballots that had been counted.

S'luanda angola  from his doorstep paulo silva can see emblems of his countrys transformation from waraddled basket case to petroleum powerhouse a flock of cranes hovers over a skyline dotted with climbing skyscrapers and dead center is a symbol of the countrys multiparty democracy the halfbuilt dome of the new home of angolas parliament         but as angolans go to the polls on friday for the third time in the countrys troubled history mr silva for one does not plan to vote for the party that built this city of plenty from the slum where he spends his days evidence of the nations wealth looms before his eyes just out of reach         angola is a rich country but we dont get any of it said mr silva who plans to vote for an opposition party the people in power are eating all the money         the governing popular movement for the liberation of angola which has been in power for more than three decades is expected to win the vote handily its leader president jos eduardo dos santos has been in office longer than almost any other african head of state and with complete control over the state media and vast campaign funds at his disposal his victory is all but assured         with the help of huge offshore deposits of oil that have made angola africas secondbiggest producer of crude mr dos santos has built a nation where porsches and lamborghinis ply the city streets and luxury apartments loom over the skyline and where the wellheeled dance at nightclubs with a  cover charge         but millions of angolans have been left behind a vast gap yawns between the wellconnected penthouseowning rich and the slumdwelling unemployed poor like mr silva         we need a change in this country mr silva said         in a tacit acknowledgment of its failure to share the fruits of growth equally the governing party unveiled a new slogan for this campaign more growth better distribution         angola is one of several african countries that have molded their governments in an unspoken fashion on what is widely known as the chinese model leaders who have been in power for decades in countries like angola ethiopia rwanda and uganda have delivered considerable economic growth and by some measures improvements in health education and development         leaders of these nations all of them scarred by internal conflict have offered their citizens an implicit bargain of development and stability in exchange for robust democracy         but the limits of this model are becoming apparent protest movements  often led not by the poor who are usually shut out of the benefits of rapid growth but by a frustrated hemmedin middle class  have chipped away at support for longstanding presidents like mr dos santos yoweri museveni of uganda and meles zenawi of ethiopia who died on aug          in angola a wave of protests beginning last year and inspired by the arab spring has shaken confidence in that formula first young people and then military veterans took to the streets prompting harsh police crackdowns         they try to follow the chinese model but they dont even give bread in exchange for freedom said rafael marques de morais an anticorruption activist and journalist         angolas brutal history long taught its people to value peace above all else the portuguese colonists fled the country in  after withering battles with three guerrilla armies and a coup dtat back home that brought a leftist government to power         the victorious angolan rebels soon turned on one another and a sprawling conflict stoked by cold war rivalries and angolas rich diamond deposits flattened the country it did not fully end until  when jonas savimbi the charismatic but brutal leader of the national union for the total independence of angola or unita was killed in a skirmish         even before the end of the war the countrys economy had begun to grow rapidly because of the oil deposits close ties with china have produced an infrastructure boom fueled by cheap oilbacked loans         but accusations of corruption gnaw at the governing party and it has clamped down hard in response to the wave of protest arresting organizers and roughing up participants mr dos santoss popularity has also waned many analysts say at an election rally held outside a huge stadium on the edge of the capital luanda on wednesday loudspeakers carried the sound of recorded applause apparently to spare him the embarrassment of a muted response to his speech         the youth protest movement fueled by popular rap stars who rhyme about corruption and poverty amid plenty is using social media and text messaging to collect reports of election irregularities said luaty beirao a rapper who goes by the name ikonaklasta         we have no access to public media so we have to use the web or any means we can to get the word out mr beirao said         mihaela neto webba a parliamentary candidate for unita in luanda said she had no illusions about the partys hopes for victory         all angolans know that we have a compromised democracy she said         to have a credible competitive and democratic process everyone must abide by laws but that doesnt happen         state television gives most of the coverage to mr dos santos showing what amounts to campaign commercials for hours every day         the opposition gets one hour a day ms webba said dos santos gets  hours a day         in the last election in  the governing party won more than  percent of the vote and its portion this time is expected to remain substantial despite a hightech tabletbased voter registration system early reports from poll monitors warned of long waits and erroneous registration data that told voters that their polling stations were hundreds of miles away results are not expected until saturday         a visit to the suburb of kilamba a brandnew city built with chinese help demonstrates why the president and his party remain popular wide boulevards lined with block upon block of tidy flats painted lavender mint and butterscotch await aspiring middleclass families         on friday noe joaquin manuel a yearold functionary who works for the defense ministry cracked open beers with friends on the balcony of his spotless new apartment         the government deserves to stay he said after conducting a tour of his threebedroom home they ended the war they have built bridges and roads and places like this         besides he added voting a new party into power would simply mean allowing a whole new cast of characters to get rich off the government treasury         if we change the new guys will have to steal first he said         but protests by young people with no memory of the civil war and veterans owed years of back pay have raised hopes that change is on the horizon even if the governing party wins on friday         the hope for angola is a new generation that is rising up mr de morais said they are not afraid to cross political boundaries        '

december  that ignited the entire middle east we have far more freedoms one peddler hawking fruit in the same square lamented but far fewer jobs another noted that mohamed bouazizi the vendor who set himself on fire did so not to vote in a democratic election but because harassment by local officials had cost him his livelihood         as the peddlers vented prayers ended at the whitewashed mosque across the street among the faithful were salafis ultraconservative sunni muslims vying to define the new order according to seventhcentury religious traditions rather than earthly realities for years many salafis  salaf means predecessors  had avoided politics and embraced autocrats as long as they were muslims but over the past eight months clusters of worshipers across the middle east have morphed into powerful salafi movements that are tapping into the disillusionment and disorder of transitions         a new salafi crescent radiating from the persian gulf sheikdoms into the levant and north africa is one of the most underappreciated and disturbing byproducts of the arab revolts in varying degrees these populist puritans are moving into the political space once occupied by jihadi militants who are now less in vogue both are fundamentalists who favor a new order modeled on early islam salafis are not necessarily fighters however many disavow violence         in tunisia salafis started the reform front party in may and led protests including in sidi bouzid this summer theyve repeatedly attacked symbols of the new freedom of speech ransacking an art gallery and blocking sufi musicians and political comedians from performing in egypt salafis emerged last year from obscurity hastily formed parties and in january won  percent of the seats in parliament  second only to the yearold muslim brotherhood salafis are a growing influence in syrias rebellion and they have parties or factions in algeria bahrain kuwait libya yemen and among palestinians         salafis are only one slice of a rapidly evolving islamist spectrum the variety of islamists in the early st century recalls socialisms many shades in the th now as then some islamists are more hazardous to western interests and values than others the salafis are most averse to minority and womens rights         a common denominator among disparate salafi groups is inspiration and support from wahhabis a puritanical strain of sunni islam from saudi arabia not all saudis are wahhabis not all salafis are wahhabis either but wahhabis are basically all salafis and many arabs particularly outside the sparsely populated gulf suspect that wahhabis are trying to seize the future by aiding and abetting the regions newly politicized salafis  as they did  years ago by funding the south asian madrassas that produced afghanistans taliban         salafis go much further in restricting political and personal life than the larger and more modern islamist parties that have won electoral pluralities in egypt tunisia and morocco since october for most arabs the rallying cry is justice both economic and political for salafis it is also about a virtue that is inflexible and enforceable         you have two choices heaven or hellfire sheikh muhammad elkurdi instructed me after his election to egypts parliament as a member of al nour a salafi party it favors gender segregation in schools and offices he told me so that men can concentrate its ok for you to be in the room he explained you are our guest and we know why youre here but you are one woman and we are three men  and we all want to marry you marriage may have been a euphemism         other more modern islamists fear the salafi factor the salafis try to push us said rachid alghannouchi founder of ennahda the ruling islamist party in tunisia the two islamist groups there are now rivals salafis are against drafting a constitution they think it is the koran grumbled merhzia labidi the vice chairwoman of tunisias constituent assembly and a member of ennahda         salafis are deepening the divide between sunni and shiite muslims and challenging the shiite crescent a term coined by jordans king abdullah in  during the iraq war to describe an arc of influence from shiitedominated iran to its allies in iraq syria and lebanon today these rival crescents risk turning countries in transition into battlefields over the regions future         the salafis represent a painful longterm conundrum for the west their goals are the most antiwestern of any islamist parties they are trying to push both secularists and other islamists into the notalwaysvirtuous past         american policy recently had its own awakening after  years of support for autocratic rulers the united states opted to embrace people power and electoral change in tunisia egypt libya morocco and yemen yet washington still embraces authoritarian gulf monarchies like saudi arabia tolerating their vague promises of reform and even pledging the united states might to protect them         foreign policy should be nuanced whether because of oil needs or to counter threats from iran but there is something dreadfully wrong with tying americas future position in the region to the birthplace and bastion of salafism and its warped vision of a new order        '

S'                    houston  the united states is increasing its dependence on oil from saudi arabia raising its imports from the kingdom by more than  percent this year even as fears of military conflict in the tinderbox persian gulf region growthe increase in saudi oil exports to the united states began slowly last summer and has picked up pace this year until then the united states had decreased its dependence on foreign oil and from the gulf in particular                             this reversal is driven in part by the battle over irans nuclear program the united states tightened sanctions that hampered irans ability to sell crude the lifeline of its troubled economy and saudi arabia agreed to increase production to help guarantee that the price did not skyrocket while prices have remained relatively stable and tehrans treasury has been squeezed the united states is left increasingly vulnerable to a region in turmoil                             the jump in saudi oil production has been welcomed by washington and european governments but saudi society faces its own challenges with the recent deaths of senior members of the royal family and sectarian strife in the eastern part of the country making the stability of saudi energy and political policies uncertain                             the united states has had a political alliance with the saudi leadership that has lasted for decades one that has become even more pivotal to washington during the turmoil of the arab spring and rising hostilities with iran over that nations nuclear program saudi arabia and iran are bitter regional rivals                             the development underscores how difficult it is for the united states to lower its dependence on foreign oil  especially the heavy grades of crude that saudi arabia exports  even as domestic oil production is soaring it is a development that has alarmed conservative and liberal foreign policy experts alike especially with oil prices and mideast tensions rising in recent weeks                             at a time when there is a rising chance of either a nuclear iran or an israeli strike on irans nuclear facilities we should be trying to reduce our reliance on oil going through the strait of hormuz and not increasing it said michael makovsky a former defense department official who worked on middle east issues in the george w bush administration                             senior iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to close the strait of hormuz the narrow neck through which most gulf oil is shipped and the iranian navy has held maneuvers to back up the threats most analysts say it is doubtful the iranians would take such an extreme measure because that would block exports vital to the countrys economy but the united states navy has been preparing for such a contingency                             many oil experts say that the increasing dependency is probably going to last only a couple of years or until more canadian and gulf of mexico production comes on line                             until we have the ability to access more canadian heavy oil through improved infrastructure the vulnerability will remain said david l goldwyn former state department coordinator for international energy affairs in the obama administration the potential for an obstruction of the strait of hormuz therefore poses a physical threat to us supply as well as a potential price shock on a global level                             obama administration officials said they were not overly worried for several reasons in the event of a crisis the united states could always dip into strategic petroleum reserves domestic production continues to climb and gulf of mexico refineries could be adjusted to use higherquality sweeter crude oil imported from other countries                             there are going to be tensions in the middle east whether that oil is going to the united states or going to somewhere else said adam sieminski administrator of the energy departments energy information administration and if oil prices go up because of a problem in the middle east that causes a problem for the world in general and not one that is specific to the united states                             in the united states several oil refining companies have found it necessary to buy more crude from saudi arabia and kuwait to make up for declining production from mexico and venezuela insufficient pipeline connections between the united states and canadian oil sands fields and the fallout from the  bp disaster which led to a yearlong drilling moratorium in the gulf of mexico                             as refiners we buy from wherever the supply is readily available and where we can get the best price said bill day a spokesman for valero energy the largest domestic refiner                             the united states imported a daily average of more than  million barrels of saudi crude over the first five months of this year compared to a daily average of roughly  million billion barrels over the same period last year according to energy department estimates similar increases have come from kuwait and iraq even while total opec and nonopec imports declined the united states has imported little iranian oil in recent years                             in recent years united states oil imports have been trending lower although total imports are little changed from the end of last year but the big change came in imports from the persian gulf spiking to  million barrels a day in may from  million barrels a day last december now roughly  percent of total imports compared with about  percent before                             domestic oil production has been surging the last three years and is up  percent this year but most of the new production is coming from shale oil fields in north dakota and texas that produce highquality sweet grades many of the refineries on the gulf of mexico coast are designed to refine the heavier oils that the united states has traditionally imported from venezuela mexico and canada                             mexican and venezuelan production has been sliding the last few years and much of that oil has been replaced by canadian oil from oil sands while canadian production has been increasing rapidly in recent years there is not enough pipeline capacity                             there are also echoes from the disastrous bp gulf of mexico well explosion and spill in  which led to a federal moratorium on gulf drilling before the accident gulf oil production was  million barrels a day and it was projected to increase to  million barrels a day by this year                             instead because of the yearlong halt on new drilling production is about  barrels a day lower than forecast much of that oil is heavy and is being replaced by saudi imports experts said                             the boost in saudi shipments to the united states also represents a swing for the kingdom which had been shifting exports to china in the wake of the  financial crisis and recession                             the us market for sour crude is looking very good for saudi arabia this year while the chinese market is looking pretty bad said edward morse citigroup global head of commodity research he noted that demand for crude in china grew by less than  percent over the first half of the year                             saudi oil experts said the kingdom was merely following the markets                             this is strictly totally business said sadad al husseini a former executive at saudi aramco the state oil company saudi production is flat out where you send it is a matter of where you make the best profit                             photo fishermen in the gulf of oman off the united arab emirates us imports from the region hit  million barrels a day in may

S'london  so now we know mitt romney believes the  north american colonies caused needless bloodshed by rejecting british authority declaring independence in  and waging war rather than encouraging king george iii to see the error of his imperial ways go touchyfeely with the upstarts across the atlantic and grant freedom to the united states of america         the revolution could have been a consensual bloodless glide to liberty if only washington jefferson and their cohorts had taken the time to convince the british monarch that empires were yesterdays news and their freedom agenda the way to go         that at least is what i take away from romneys hilarious suggestion that ben ali mubarak qaddafi and saleh  with almost  years of despotic rule between them  could have been transformed into democrats and their societies changed in a more peaceful manner if president obama had stuck with his predecessors freedom agenda and gotten mubarak to move toward a more democratic posture         we all know what george w bushs freedom agenda was in egypt tunisia libya yemen and elsewhere two vapid words no democrat could count on and every security goon could laugh at we also know  look at syria  dictators who have spent decades ruling through fear do not go quietly into the night any more than great powers readily abandon their profitable dominions         and i thought these finance guys were hardnosed realists laserfocused on the bottom line dream on mitt dream on even if your dreams to use that word you let drop on the olympics in london and then scrambled to retract are disconcerting         i know the presumptive republican candidate is trying to become president facing a cool incumbent who does have a laser focus so his words  i was going to say rhetoric  are less prescriptions for future policy than ploys for gaining power still romney has been piling on the foreign policy foolishness         the arab spring he reckons is not appropriately named does mitt want a more autumnal wintry or even polar metaphor for the brave uprising of millions of arabs against tyrants in the greatest push for freedom since  he will only say that it has become a development of more concern         hmmm concern to whom romney suffers from scips  sudden collapse into passive syndrome as you try to pin him down the declarative transitive sentences vanish as fast as vapor trails         romney affects a firstperson plural form dear to george iii he says that were very concerned in seeing the new leader in egypt as an islamist leader well theres an alternative mitt see mohamed morsi as a president democratically elected by tens of millions of egyptians who has committed to uphold all his nations international agreements they include the peace with israel and declared that we as egyptians muslims and christians are preachers of civilization and building so we were and so we will remain god willing         in israel where both prime minister benjamin netanyahus terms as prime minister have coincided to his chagrin with democratic presidencies in the united states romney was rapturously received as uri misgav noted in the daily haaretz netanyahu doesnt speak english or even american he speaks fluent republicanese         romney went through a de rigueur list of the ways obama  in israel hes often called barack hussein obama  has supposedly failed the jewish state public criticism of it usurping israels role as primary peace negotiator alluding to the  borders as a basis for peace when they are indefensible         in fact obama has been a staunch supporter of israel vetoing a united nations resolution that used his own critical words on the settlements ceding to netanyahus kickthecandowntheroad tactics making clear there can be agreed territorial swaps in any twostate deal and stating that the united states will not allow iran to go nuclear         but the heart of the matter lies elsewhere obama actually believes in a palestinian state romney is loved by netanyahus likud party because he gives signals he does not in jerusalem he attends a breakfast fundraiser with sheldon adelson the billionaire american casino mogul and largest donor to the romney super pac adelson is the man who said newt gingrich was right to call the palestinians an invented people         romney then suggests palestinians are culturally inferior incapable of showing the economic vitality of israel  as if a people under occupation without a port or an airport controlling neither their territorial nor their air space facing roadblocks walls barriers fences labyrinthine bureaucracy and capricious humiliation are somehow deficient in not turning themselves into singapore         in fact romney missed the great cultural change in the middle east of which many palestinians have been part the shift from a paralyzing culture of victimhood encouraged by exploitive tyrants to a culture of agency in which arabs are learning  with difficulty  that they can shape their own lives and that the israelipalestinian conflict is a distraction often cynically used from their ability to succeed         that is why the arab spring is appropriately named and was needed just as the american revolution was appropriately named and necessary             '

VSOFIA, Bulgaria -- Nearly two weeks after the bombing of a busload of Israeli tourists, Bulgarian investigators said they had yet to identify the bomber, and did not publicly indicate who they believed was behind the attack. But if the trail remains murky, the impact of the disaster on this small Balkan nation is clear: It has jeopardized its strong ties with both Israel and the Arab countries of the Middle East. Bulgarian officials have been notably reluctant to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in publicly pinning blame for the attack, which killed five Israelis and a Bulgarian bus driver, on Hezbollah and Iran, a view privately shared by American officials. Instead, the government has tried to contain details about the investigation, hoping to avoid mistakes in a situation with global political and security implications, as evidence grows of a shadow war between Israel on one side and Iran and Hezbollah on the other.

was behind the attack but if the trail remains murky the impact of the disaster on this small balkan nation is clear it has jeopardized its strong ties with both israel and the arab countries of the middle east         bulgarian officials have been notably reluctant to join prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel in publicly pinning blame for the attack which killed five israelis and a bulgarian bus driver on hezbollah and iran a view privately shared by american officials instead the government has tried to contain details about the investigation hoping to avoid mistakes in a situation with global political and security implications as evidence grows of a shadow war between israel on one side and iran and hezbollah on the other         for small bulgaria to come out and openly name hezbollah in such a way is as good as entering a minefield said vladimir shopov a political scientist at the new bulgarian university in sofia there would have to be absolute certainty almost youd have to be really really confident that your convincing evidence could stand up before all the other members of the eu         a member of the bulgarian security establishment speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing said that there was a clear direction that points to hezbollah in the pattern and evidence of the attack but that it would probably be some time before any official determination was made         unlike the united states and israel which officially list hezbollah as a terrorist organization the european union thus far has refused to blacklist the organization which is a political party as well as a militant group and since last year has been part of the lebanese government the stakes are unusually high for a country with a population just over seven million smaller than new york city whose political class is normally occupied by what mr shopov called blissful parochialism         bulgaria is perched precariously between serbia crisisafflicted greece and a rising regional power in turkey its nextdoor neighbor to the southeast a member of nato as well as the european union it has been working with the help of its western partners to overcome a legacy of corruption and organized crime         the country has a sizable indigenous muslim population estimated at  percent mostly ethnic turks but also slavic muslims and immigrants from the middle east bulgaria has a muslim minority we have many arabs who came to the country and we dont want them to feel stigmatized in any way or form because of this act nickolay mladenov bulgarias foreign minister said in an interview         this is a quiet country mr mladenov added and we would like to keep it quiet         the countrys commitments and international presence have changed in recent years reflecting its new partnerships bulgaria had soldiers stationed in iraq and still has about  troops among the nato force in afghanistan mr mladenov has tried to engage bulgaria in the arab spring in may members of the syrian opposition met in bulgaria         in a flurry of activity after the bombing bulgarian officials quickly released video of the bomber waiting outside the arrivals gate of the airport but that has been replaced by stillness as investigators wait for the bombers dna and fingerprints to be run through international databases mr mladenov dismissed criticism of the slow pace of the investigation lets give the people working on this enough space to do their work he said         the countrys prime minister boyko borissov said last week that the attack was the work of an exceptionally experienced group of conspirators many of the statements made by officials here seem aimed at deflecting criticism at home over the investigation         the more time passes the slimmer the chances are that they will be able to identify the attacker said mihail mikov a member of parliament for the opposition socialist party if they dont find out who the bomber was within  or  days i dont believe this will happen mr mikov said         tsvetan tsvetanov bulgarias interior minister said in an interview that investigators were further along than they could publicly discuss without jeopardizing new leads its very important when you talk to the public that you say something where you have evidence and proof and not just go and give opinions he said         mr tsvetanov said that the bomber had been in bulgaria for  days before the attack and that that investigators had learned where the fake michigan drivers license belonging to the suicide bomber had been made outside the region he said we also have suggestions about the groups who might have organized such a terrorist act but they cant be mentioned publicly until the investigation is over mr tsvetanov said         when the bombing took place top bulgarian officials were at a news conference in response to a european commission report that said its progress in combating organized crime and corruption was not yet sustainable and irreversible the special prosecutor and special court likely to handle the terrorism case began operations only on jan  of this year         from my perspective no one was really seeing terrorism as particularly a field which was going to be active said katia hristovavaltcheva head of the cabinet at the ministry of justice         the former head of the national intelligence service lt gen kircho kirov said he was not surprised by the attack in the last five or six years we have had very concrete information that organizations like hezbollah and structures connected to al qaeda as well as some individuals were ready to prepare attacks general kirov said         in january before he left the service there was very concrete information about attacks against israeli tourists general kirov said we organized measures to prevent them the winter tourist season passed without incident the summer season did

VTUNIS -- Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said Sunday that he did not think Israel had yet made a decision to strike Iran, but that his goal in meeting with the Israeli leadership this week was to strengthen ties with the United States ''so that we can be fully prepared to deal with any contingency that may happen.'' Mr. Panetta made his comments to reporters on his plane as he headed to Tunis, Tunisia's capital, the first stop on a five-day trip to North Africa and the Middle East. He is to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak.

VIt won't help him win many votes this year, but it should be noted that Barack Obama has been a good foreign policy president. He, Vice President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the rest of his team have created a style of policy making that is flexible, incremental and well adapted to the specific circumstances of this moment. Following a foreign policy hedgehog, Obama's been a pretty effective fox. Some eras call for bold doctrines, new global architecture and ''Present at the Creation'' moments. This is not one of those eras. Today, the world is like a cocktail party at which everybody is suffering from indigestion or some other internal ailment. People are interacting with each other, but they're mostly focused on the godawful stuff going on inside. Europe has the euro mess. The Middle East has the Arab Spring. The U.S. has the economic stagnation and the debt. The Chinese have their perpetual growth and stability issues.

S'jerusalem  there are no empty beds this day in the recovery room at the hadassahein kerem hospital doctors and nurses hover over patients manar igbarya  is giving a woman an injection and inspecting a bandage on her right leg the orthodox patient is absorbed in talking to her visiting husband everyone is chatting in hebrew nothing in this scene seems unusual except that ms igbarya is a palestinian muslim         muna alayan  who works as a secretary in the same hospital wears a hijab everyone recognizes her as a muslim she said it had been hard for her to find a job in the past because of that but she was accepted at the hospital because all they cared about was how i do my job every so often she said smiling a patient is surprised to see a muslim working here         ashgan  who asked not to be identified by her family name works in the operating room as a nurse we all speak hebrew and all we do here is our job though we all carry our palestinian identity inside us she said looking at the other two women no one can forget their identity         while more traditional palestinian women marry in their early s the members of this trio are all single each of them characterized the world inside the hospital as very different from that outside its walls where arab and jewish israelis live  at least in some places  side by side but barely interact         we are a team here and there is no difference if one is jewish or muslim or christian the task is to help the patients ms igbarya said sometimes she said she glimpses questions in the eyes of some jewish patients if they hear her speaking arabic to ms ayan or to ashgan         there is a tension to jerusalem even more intense than in other parts of israel in part because the city itself is a key source of dispute important as it is to the religion of both jews and muslims         people in jerusalem from both sides are very difficult and there is a lot of anger ashgan said the conflict is influencing all our lives directly here we are not living in dreamland         ms ayan lives with her parents in a mixed neighborhood in jerusalem their nextdoor neighbor is jewish and ms ayan said her father used to be friends with him until the second intifada broke out in  then his son started throwing stones at our door because we were muslim she said adding that sometimes opinions vary within families on either side         arabs and jews work together in other places in israel but hadassah hospital is one of the few places where they confront the bloody side of conflict immediately and together both sides admit that this is not easy         in some cases muslim nurses treat israeli soldiers wounded in fights with palestinians while their jewish colleagues also attend to palestinians who attacked jews this is a learning process for all of us ashgan said but we treat first the patient and then maybe later we hear what the story was         it is the hospitals policy to treat patients equally regardless of their religious or ethnic background founded by hadassah the womens zionist organization of america  in  in the southwest of jerusalem hadassahein kerem is one of the largest medical complexes in israel another campus called hadassah mount scopus was founded in  in the northeast part of jerusalem         the hospital is the scene of interactions hard to experience outside its walls avichayil hindi  for example calls herself an orthodox jewish girl who grew up in a settlement with no arabs she came to the hospital in september to fulfill her national service requirement choosing a social role rather than serving in the military as most young israelis do i had never been in touch with arab people before she said before i came here i thought arabs are bad people who only want to attack and kill jews         since she began working at the hospital she and ms ayan have become friends who go for coffee or lunch in the cafeteria together i have learned here that arabs also have families and i learned what their perspective of this conflict is ms hindi said         even with such insights there appears to be little common view of the possible solution to the israelipalestinian conflict asked what they thought the three arab women said the only solution would be a twostate solution         ms hindi by contrast said there is no solution and certainly not one that requires jews to give up land         the popular revolts of the arab spring the question of how the world would react if those revolts reached palestinian areas the uncertainty of the outcome in an evermore violent syria and the future attitude of egypt under president mohamed morsi all weighed on their minds         indeed all four women noted that their contact was possible only because the hospitals leadership made it so clear that there was to be no discrimination among patients or staff as long as we keep politics out of it said ashgan all is good        '

VLONDON -- One of the cooler places to hang out in Saudi Arabia is a motor racing track built among grassy dunes on the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh. Wealthy drivers, including at least one prince, race their Porsches and Lamborghinis there in front of an adoring crowd of young Saudis -- some of them wearing reversed baseball caps and baggy jeans. The twisty circuit is built to the highest specifications and managed with a big emphasis on safety. Still, it is hard not to see the track as emblematic of a Saudi and Gulf culture of lavish and ever-increasing consumption -- fast cars, gargantuan shopping malls, grandiose homes -- all dependent on abundant and cheap gasoline and electric power. Saudi Arabia's oil use has nearly doubled over the last decade to 2.9 million barrels per day, about a third of what it usually produces.

S'london  one of the cooler places to hang out in saudi arabia is a motor racing track built among grassy dunes on the outskirts of the capital riyadh wealthy drivers including at least one prince race their porsches and lamborghinis there in front of an adoring crowd of young saudis  some of them wearing reversed baseball caps and baggy jeans         the twisty circuit is built to the highest specifications and managed with a big emphasis on safety still it is hard not to see the track as emblematic of a saudi and gulf culture of lavish and everincreasing consumption  fast cars gargantuan shopping malls grandiose homes  all dependent on abundant and cheap gasoline and electric power saudi arabias oil use has nearly doubled over the last decade to  million barrels per day about a third of what it usually produces         saudi oil consumption cannot go on growing this way a few cassandras are warning its not sustainable because domestic consumption is growing at an alarming rate it is going to eventually eat into exports said paul stevens an energy expert at chatham house a research institute in london         seeing the dangers of their countries enormous use of fossil fuels some saudi and gulf energy officials are examining alternatives including solar and nuclear power         so far abu dhabi the main oil producer in the united arab emirates has been the most out front through its masdar futureenergy company saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have been leaders in energy said sultan al jaber masdars chief executive leadership entails responsibility         whatever saudi representatives say the kingdoms oil industry will struggle to produce more than  million or  million barrels per day of oil so the oil saudis burn at home inevitably reduces what is available for export         burning so much oil and natural gas is also damaging the environment kuwait qatar and the united arab emirates are among the worlds biggest carbon emitters per capita they are also global leaders in diabetes due in part to residents driving everywhere  forgoing physical exercise  and their fastfood habit there is now a joke circulating in kuwait that if you do not have diabetes you are not a kuwaiti         the oil states are also finding that they do not have enough natural gas to keep the lights on and the airconditioning running or to promise new factories power plants in places like saudi arabia and kuwait are substituting oil which is dirtier and less efficient than natural gas burning oil is also wasteful because it could be exported almost the entire middle east is gasshort said siamak namazi of access consulting group in dubai         until recently most of the gulf countries had little interest in natural gas they flared it into the atmosphere in huge quantities qatar and iran are the exceptions with huge naturalgas reserves but qatar does not want to sell much natural gas at the rockbottom prices prevailing in its neighbors and iran is politically isolated with an industry so ineptly managed that it is importing gas itself         these conundrums are pushing the saudis and others to think about their energy use abu dhabi has made the largest commitment to alternative energy so far through masdar which has received a lot of hype but is taking concrete action the company is pursuing a range of initiatives including large solar energy complexes at home and abroad and a research center in a joint venture with the massachusetts institute of technology         abu dhabi has ordered four nuclear plants from south korea not to be outdone the saudis are drawing up plans for an even bigger nuclear effort that could add to regional tensions         the saudis are also planning to add  gigawatts of solar capacity to their grid over the next  years that is an enormous amount roughly equivalent to saudi arabias entire current power capacity the goal may not be realistic because the saudis have close to zero solar power now but they have hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank to spend it is inevitable that we are going to have gigawatts of solar installed said sadad husseini a former senior executive at saudi aramco the national oil company         vahid fotuhi head of the emirates solar industry association said that sharply falling prices of solar panels were making the suns energy competitive with fossil fuels         the easiest way to cut energy use is to raise prices but most of the gulf states are reluctant to tamper with the neargiveaway cost of energy that their citizens consider a birthright if anything the arab spring revolutions have made the rulers even more wary of changing the status quo no matter how much waste it encourages         it encourages a lot saudi arabias filling stations dispense gasoline for about  cents per gallon or  cents per liter electricity producers pay just  per barrel for oil or about  percent of the world price and  cents per million british thermal units for natural gas  a very low price not surprisingly saudi arabia uses  times as much energy per unit of economic growth as the world average         a study by mr stevens of chatham house shows that if business as usual continues saudi arabias oil consumption could actually eat up all its exports by  that of course is not the most likely scenario if nothing else the saudis would probably go bust well before because they have few other sources of revenue but the prospect shows that there are big incentives for the saudis and other gulf countries to change their energywasting ways        '

S'antakya turkey  abu moayed a commander in an armed syrian opposition brigade stood and waved his arms emphatically at the fellow rebel commanders who filled the sweltering room         his fighters he said needed money and weapons but they were not getting the support promised from the donors and opposition leaders outside syria         we are borrowing money to feed our wounded abu moayed shouted there is no distribution of the weapons he added all of our weapons we are paying for them ourselves         the meeting of the rebel commanders held after friday prayer in this turkish city near syrias northern border said much about the priorities of the syrian opposition fighting groups at this stage of the conflict now  months old there was limited discussion of the mass killings in the village of tremseh the day before  even though the commanders had heard about it and at least one had lost relatives there was no talk about united nations ceasefire monitors the peace envoy kofi annan or endless security council debates to halt the conflict these commanders were focused on the basics of waging war against president bashar alassad         abu moayed from idlib was one of dozens of commanders who converged on the meeting called by the idlib revolutionary command council held high above the street in a pair of large rooms in an apartment building the gathering framed both a degree of expanding coordination among antiassad fighting groups inside syria and their frustrations with the oppositions political leadership outside         one complaint throughout was that the syrian national council the coalition of exile opposition groups based in istanbul was disconnected from the battles fought on the ground another was contained in the field commanders suspicion that unnamed members of the syrian political opposition in turkey were either diverting funds or playing favorites in funneling weapons and money across the border         yesterday we were supposed to receive mortars and cartridges said another commander issam afara addressing his peers but we didnt receive them i called and demanded where are they where         since late this spring the war in parts of syria has entered a bloody stalemate punctuated by days of intense violence like the mass killing on thursday in tremseh the sunni village in western syria where by some opposition groups estimates more than  people were killed by syrian armed forces and proassad militia members using tanks artillery and helicopters         international outrage over those killings which the syrian government said were carried out by rebels has injected new urgency into diplomatic efforts to settle the syria conflict at the security council there diplomats were negotiating privately on friday over a new resolution to force the antagonists to honor a ceasefire and peace plan engineered by mr annan the special envoy from the united nations and the arab league a vote on that resolution is likely next wednesday         the diplomacy seemed a world away and possibly too late when viewed through the prism of the antiassad fighters who have driven much of the syrian military forces from certain rural zones in the northern mountains carving out small but mostly stable areas now under their de facto control though these areas still face shelling and attack from the air by mr assads military         as they have realized tactical success the antiassad fighting groups once underground now face a problem common to armed uprisings         at least  different fighting groups operate in idlib alone the fighters said most of which began as small personal networks or groups of army defectors and have since grown         the groups sometimes share names and often operate in the same areas and as they have added members and sought more weapons and external support some of them have found themselves competing for resources and frustrated with syrians who claim leadership positions in the opposition and do not fight but disburse funds that many fighting groups say they do not receive         mr afara for example said money funneled through the muslim brotherhood was not shared with fighting groups seen as secular which angered fighters who had turned back the assad military at great cost and now are told they do not match a foreign donors ideal         we tell them we are not brothers said mr afara who leads a unit in a larger group called the idlib martyrs brigade how we are muslims and we want a full popular revolution with muslims and christians and druze        '

VNINETY minutes into what was supposed to be an hourlong snowshoe walk up the craggy Great St. Bernard Pass in the Alps, my Swiss guide -- Patrick Vincent, professor of literature at the Universit de Neuchtel -- swore that the 11th-century monastery we'd set out for was just around the next bend. The structure, perched on this 8,100-foot-high pass where the snowy seams of Switzerland, Italy and France converge, has a storied history: it was founded by St. Bernard himself, is the birthplace of the iconic dog bred by the monks, and it provided room and board for illustrious visitors like Napoleon and Alexandre Dumas. But I wanted to see it for a different reason. I was retracing the steps of Charles Dickens, who ascended this same pass to get to the monastery while living in Switzerland in 1846. Though known mostly for his depiction of gritty London streets and of his travels to America, Dickens was also inspired by Switzerland, where he spent five months writing ''Dombey and Son,'' found inspiration for ''Little Dorrit'' and ''David Copperfield'' and finished his fourth Christmas story. His visit was no mere writer's retreat: he temporarily moved his wife, six children and the family dog to Lausanne, where they lived in a villa staffed with four servants.

                      though known mostly for his depiction of gritty london streets and of his travels to america dickens was also inspired by switzerland where he spent five months writing dombey and son found inspiration for little dorrit and david copperfield and finished his fourth christmas story his visit was no mere writers retreat he temporarily moved his wife six children and the family dog to lausanne where they lived in a villa staffed with four servants                             dickens found time to explore the country with his family and friends and recounted his impressions in a ream of private letters many of them prickly that nonetheless indicated his unabashed love for switzerland oh god what a beautiful country it is he proclaimed in one letter to john forster his friend and later biographer he became so fond of switzerland that over the course of his life he visited four times and created a permanent souvenir in england he reassembled a thcentury swiss chalet that a friend had mailed to him he used it as a study even connecting it to his home via an underground tunnel in true helvetic style                             this spring i set out on a fourday trip to explore three areas of switzerland frequented by dickens in hopes of discovering what kept him coming back in addition to the great st bernard pass which dickens took before overnighting at the monastery i would stop in lausanne where the dickens family stayed in a villa overlooking lake geneva and the lavaux vineyards where the writer took long nightly walks these settings described below became an occasional writers muse                             the great st bernard pass and monastery                             we traveled to the great st bernard pass from lausanne by car on a mile route that hugged the easternmost hook of switzerland passing clusters of chalets and steep vineyard terraces that resembled machu picchu                             after parking in the abandoned super stbernard resort we began a climb up the gusty trail dickens came in september so there was no snow shouted the professor tightening his snowshoes as downhill skiers zipped past us dropping chirpy bonjours along the way and he traveled on mule                             we didnt have a mule and thats not the only difference between our journey and dickenss he and his member party including his wife kate and two servants traveled to the pass from lausanne by steamer then coach then mule the roundtrip journey took them four days and the last leg through the steep valley of desolation described by dickens as awful and tremendous is probably no easier to climb today than it was in                              dickens was an early alpine traveler arriving  years before queen victorias climb up toothy mount pilatus which marked the apex of switzerlands golden age of alpine exploration in another letter to forster dickenss description of the monastery revealed his terror and reverence of the alps a great hollow on top of a range of dreadful mountains and in the midst a black lake with phantom clouds perpetually stalking over it the air so fine it is difficult to breathe  the cold so exquisitely thin and sharp that it is not to be described                             that description was a contrast to the scene that i took in when i reached the entrance to the monastery  just moments ahead of a group of older local snowshoers id barely managed to pass on the trail the views of italy france and switzerland were downright halcyon and the lake was not cloudy and black but frostblue under a hyacinth sky we were met by a monk who insisted we nourish ourselves over bowls of soup totally winded from the fourmile ascent i made a beeline for the communal tables in the stone dining hall the vegetable soup came with a generous slab of creamy bagnes cheese honeysweetened tea thick slices of brown bread and a carafe of red dwine produced in the valais region just below us                             dickens wrote in a letter that he supped thirty strong in a rambling room with a great woodfire probably nourishing himself on the same local cheese and wine that the monks serve today but you wont find his name on the francocentric register of les passants cbres which includes charlemagne napoleon and dumas its no surprise considering that in various letters he described the monks as grim lazy and a piece of sheer humbug though its still possible to stay the night as dickens did i stayed for just a few hours filling my time with a quick tour of the monasterys oddball museum which showcased local taxidermy and ancient coins and maps once used for passage i also searched for the yearold crypt allegedly stuffed with the bodies of ancient travelers who didnt survive the crossing        '

S'moscow  as global powers prepared for an thhour effort to revive the stalled peace effort in syria kofi annan the special envoy and mediator who called the meeting said on friday he was optimistic that the talks in geneva would yield an acceptable result despite russian calls for changes in his settlement ideas         i think we are going to have a good meeting on saturday mr annan told reuters television in geneva as senior officials held preparatory talks in advance of the weekend encounter of foreign ministers including secretary of state hillary rodham clinton i am optimistic         the talks would end with an acceptable result he said despite news reports suggesting that differences between russia and other western and arab nations at the geneva meeting had raised new obstacles to an agreement         mrs clinton is set to meet on friday in st petersburg russia with her russian counterpart foreign minister sergey v lavrov the associated press reported mr lavrov said on thursday that syria needed a period of political transition but reiterated moscows resistance to any plan being imposed by the international community         in order to overcome the syrian crisis and to finally establish stable rights and norms which satisfy all groups in the syrian population it is necessary to have a transitional period this is obvious mr lavrov said at a news conference here in moscow         at the meeting in geneva on saturday mr annan the united nations and arab league special envoy could put forward a proposal for a national unity cabinet that includes opposition figures         mr lavrov said that russia has not agreed to any new version of mr annans faltering ceasefire plan and criticized diplomats for leaking details of the process to the press         there are no agreedupon plans work continues on a possible final document he said         hints of mr annans possible route to a diplomatic compromise emerged wednesday when reuters quoted unidentified diplomats as saying russia and other powers supported his idea of a syrian government of national unity that would include opposition figures but exclude those whose participation would undermine it  language that clearly was meant to refer to president bashar alassad but details were vague         part of the purpose of the meeting a diplomat based in geneva said speaking on the condition of anonymity is to uncouple the process of achieving a ceasefire from the increasing demands that mr assads government be held to account for human rights abuses which a united nations panel said wednesday have continued on an alarming scale  i consider it a sign of an unscrupulous approach to diplomacy that there are leaks to the press about certain formulas certain ideas that are being recommended as part of a final document by specific countries mr lavrov said         russia has adamantly opposed any transition plan conditional on mr assads departure and has insisted that opposition figures must negotiate with the government if the crisis is to be resolved mr lavrov reiterated that position in his comments on thursday         we will not support and cannot support any interference from outside or any imposition of recipes mr lavrov said this also concerns the fate of bashar alassad the syrian president         sergei a karaganov the dean of the department of international economics and foreign affairs at the higher school of economics in moscow said it would be unrealistic to expect russia to take an active part in implementing a transition plan         russia is not willing to be responsible for the bloodshed which is continuing there and we will not play an active role in getting assad out mr karaganov said         mr karaganov said russia might agree to support the formation of a coalition government as long as it did not include figures linked to armed resistance but added that such a process would have little substance or real effect we are involved in the diplomatic process but we are not involved in trying to solve the syrian problem one way or another he said many of our experts believe it is unsolvable         mr annan whose peace plan is in danger of collapse announced in a statement on wednesday that he was convening an action group meeting of influential countries in geneva on saturday in an effort to revive the plan         but the announcement came only after mr annan had made concessions over which countries would attend conspicuously absent from the list of the nations invited were iran the strongest regional ally of mr assad and saudi arabia a prominent supporter of mr assads enemies        '
