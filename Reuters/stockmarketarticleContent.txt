VTWO Christmases ago the director Bryan Singer was looking for a modestly scaled movie to make, something he could slide in quickly between behemoths. He had just come off three consecutive comic-book adaptations (''X-Men'' in 2000, its sequel in 2003 and ''Superman Returns'' in 2006), he had helped to create the hit Fox series ''House,'' and he was now in the market for something different. When he read ''Valkyrie,'' a script co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, who had been a friend since high school and won an Academy Award for writing Mr. Singer's most acclaimed movie, ''The Usual Suspects'' (1995), he knew he had found that change of pace.

S'two christmases ago the director bryan singer was looking for a modestly scaled movie to make something he could slide in quickly between behemoths  bryan singer director of valkyrie which opens christmas day after several delays and much speculation and gossip  he had just come off three consecutive comicbook adaptations xmen in  its sequel in  and superman returns in  he had helped to create the hit fox series house and he was now in the market for something different when he read valkyrie a script cowritten by christopher mcquarrie who had been a friend since high school and won an academy award for writing mr singers most acclaimed movie the usual suspects   he knew he had found that change of pace  two years a reported  million half a dozen internetfueled controversies and the arrival of one big movie starturnedminimogul later valkyrie with an eyepatched and jackbooted tom cruise as col  claus von stauffenberg the leader of a failed attempt within the german military to kill hitler in  arrives in theaters on dec   this was my shot at a small movie and i blew it mr singer said with a laugh during a thanksgiving week visit to new york maybe i just discovered im a bigmovie guy even when i was making usual suspects which i shot in  days for  million i had to have this giant boat this police car explosions all that stuff no matter what the circumstances are i tend to amplify the films subject matter alone promised that valkyrie would receive plenty of attention given the danger of its being used to create the countermyth of a widespread german resistance but the oppressive scrutiny of every aspect of the movies making probably became inevitable the moment mr singer and mr mcquarrie who are also two of the films producers took the script to united artists which mgm had revived for mr cruise as a boutique label  once mr singer found himself making a tom cruise movie it became hard for anything to happen quietly  in june  shortly before several months of production in germany were to commence german officials distressed by mr cruises connection to the church of scientology banned the filmmakers from using certain essential locations including the defense ministry the officials eventually relented a lawsuit filed by  extras playing german soldiers who were injured when they spilled out of the back of a truck made headlines too  release dates  june  october  february   were changed more often and more publicly than any filmmaker would like and more recent speculation about valkyrie has centered on things like a change in the advertising campaign that appears to deemphasize mr cruise and rumors of nonexistent reshoots the film did return to production months after shooting wrapped in germany but only to film a longpostponed opening set in the tunisian desert the movies stock has seemed to crest and crash with every fluctuation in the muchdiscussed fortunes of united artists and mr cruise intended to produce four films a year the studio to date has released only one lions for lambs which opened in late  to a chilly critical and commercial reception and paula wagner mr cruises longtime producing partner is no longer running the studio  the nonstop chatter is enough to make mr singer who is a slightly built and boyishlooking  amiably guarded in the presence of a reporter  its a terrible problem and im not saying that selfishly mr singer said about the advance scrutiny i understand that there is an excitement about knowing something about the making of a movie even something dramatic or scandalous but its very hard to have the experience of being transported when your mind is full of what you read very often from a notcredible source that willingness to enter the films world on its own terms will be particularly crucial for valkyrie although the history it recounts is well known in germany its less familiar to audiences in the united states  mr mcquarrie who composited characters and collapsed timelines to streamline his historical narrative said that when he first became interested in the stauffenberg story he was told you cant make a world war ii movie with no american soldiers in it let alone one about a conspiracy whose outcome is a foregone conclusion spoiler alert hitler lives he said he took it as a challenge it wasnt the only one the movie would present valkyrie asks its viewers not only to buy mr cruise as a german officer but also to accept that he and his costars  among them the british actors tom wilkinson and kenneth branagh and carice van houten who is dutch  speak in their own accents the accent question is one that continues to bedevil directors of world war ii movies the nazis in the current release the boy in the striped pajamas  deploy clipped british accents straight out of brideshead revisited and the polish and byelorussian freedom fighters in edward zwicks forthcoming defiance use lithuanian inflections if everyone was trying to do german accents the risk of it feeling false was really high mr singer said of his film it would make no sense why would they be speaking in german accents theyre german  nazis are something of a leitmotif in the work of mr singer who like mr mcquarrie and the films publicists takes pains to point out that stauffenberg was not one his  suspense film apt pupil based on a novella by stephen king depicts the creepily sadistic relationship between a former ss officer and an american teenager who discovers him living alone in a small town and it was mr singers decision to identify magneto the villain of the first xmen movie explicitly as a jewish survivor of the holocaust  for mr singer who is jewish and who grew up in princeton junction nj knowing that his adoptive parents had lost a lot of their family history to the holocaust the fascination with the subject is lifelong and fueled by influences as varied as his elementaryschool friendship with two german children and regular early doses of hogans heroes '

VThe sequel to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's enormously impressive ''Ford at Fox'' collection, released last year, ''Murnau, Borzage and Fox'' brings together a rich selection of films by two of the most important filmmakers in the history of the medium, the German director F. W. Murnau and the American Frank Borzage. The paths of these two extraordinary figures crossed briefly during a period, 1927 to 1930, when both were under contract to William Fox, by far the most artistically adventurous of the early film moguls. Fox lost control of his studio in 1930 because of financial problems related to the stock market crash, but by that point had firmly established the Fox Film Corporation as the Hollywood enterprise most friendly to personal filmmakers. That tradition continued for several decades after the company merged with Joseph Schenck's Twentieth Century Pictures in 1935, forming the corporation we know today as 20th Century Fox.

S'the sequel to th century fox home entertainments enormously impressive ford at fox collection  released last year murnau borzage and fox brings together a rich selection of films by two of the most important filmmakers in the history of the medium the german director f w murnau and the american frank borzage the paths of these two extraordinary figures crossed briefly during a period  to  when both were under contract to william fox by far the most artistically adventurous of the early film moguls  george obrien and janet gaynor in sunrise  fox lost control of his studio in  because of financial problems related to the stock market crash but by that point had firmly established the fox film corporation as the hollywood enterprise most friendly to personal filmmakers that tradition continued for several decades after the company merged with joseph schencks twentieth century pictures in  forming the corporation we know today as th century fox  its great to see fox embracing its studio heritage with such scholarly dedication and serious financial commitment only warner brothers has done anything comparable and fox has perhaps gone a bit further in releasing these sets comprehensive anthologies devoted not to genres or to stars but to major authors in the field of motion pictures  f w murnau was perhaps the most critically respected filmmaker in the world when fox offered him a contract to come to america in  his movie the last laugh    recently released in a superlative edition by kino international    had been snatched up by carl laemmle  founder of universal pictures for american release even before its german premiere  in an excellent booklet that is part of the new fox box janet bergstrom writes that fox signed murnau the day before the last laugh had its new york premiere because he did not want to be outdone by his rival laemmle  fox offered his new employee virtual carte blanche and the film that resulted in  sunrise has been part of the history books since its a selfconsciously mythic song of two humans as its subtitle phrases it the story of a farmer george obrien and his wife janet gaynor who are almost driven apart by a predatory character the film calls only woman from the city margaret livingston  there is hardly a shot or camera movement in sunrise that does not seem precisely considered wholly original and achingly expressive as murnau moves from a realistic farming village constructed on the shore of lake arrowhead outside of los angeles to an expressionistic rendition of a bustling city constructed almost entirely within the fox studio the works style was so forceful that none of foxs other major filmmakers seemed to escape its influence most conspicuously john ford whose manner would draw equally from murnaus poetic stylization and the downtoearth naturalism of d w griffith his first artistic model  but murnau seems also to have deeply affected frank borzage pronounced borezayghee already an established director with a series of social dramas and romances under his belt although as ms bergstrom notes borzage seems never to have spoken of murnau his visual approach is evident throughout th heaven the  feature that was gaynors next starring vehicle for the studio  working with the great art director harry oliver borzage constructed a stylized studio paris for his young lovers a street waif played by gaynor and an ambitious sewer worker played by borzages young discovery charles farrell a tall cleareyed massachusetts boy here cast in his first major role  borzages eternal theme  that romantic love transcends all physical circumstance with a force like that of religion   is developed in th heaven through elaborate camera movements that would probably not have been conceivable without murnaus example the visual centerpiece of the film is a shot that follows the lovers from the ground floor of a parisian tenement rising with them as they climb what appear to be six flights of stairs actually three blended by a hidden dissolve to arrive at the attic aerie that is their seventh heaven a private world that belongs to them alone  sunrise was a succs destime but th heaven was a major popular hit thanks no doubt to borzages almost magical ability to spin an aura of warmth and spiritual exaltation around his lovers he directed gaynor and farrell in two more excellent films street angel  and lucky star  both included here and farrell with other partners in three more movies included in this box the intensely erotic melodrama the river  which exists only in incomplete form a daringly theatrical adaptation of ferenc molnars fantasy liliom  for which oliver created sets even more audaciously expressionist than murnaus for sunrise and settling back to earth the lower east side love story after tomorrow   murnau borzage and fox also functions as a miniature history of the transition from silent films to sound the freefloating camera and dramatic fluidity of the silents seem to screech to a halt with borzages first alltalking picture the  will rogers vehicle they had to see paris he recovers a bit of his camera mobility with the interesting  song o my heart a musical starring the hugely popular irish tenor john mccormack in which borzage experiments for the first time with sound to create a bridge between lovers separated by space but sound also constrains borzages gossamer romanticism and his films take on the straightforward slightly embittered social realism that was beginning to dominate over at warner brothers  young america  is a warnerstyle issues film asking for sympathy for juvenile delinquents its mainly interesting though as borzages first film with spencer tracy who would become his rumpled alter ego in the talkies  most effective perhaps is the  bad girl for which borzage won his second bestdirector oscar after th heaven like so many films of the great depression it is deeply engaged with the social reality of the day drawing the portrait of a young workingclass couple james dunn and sally eilers who are nearly driven apart by economic pressures the radiant softfocus closeups of street angel give way here to a hardedged almost documentary realism but borzages ability to evoke lyrically the bonds between openhearted humans remains undiminished  of the  features in the set only sunrise has been previously released in the united states and it has here been given a fine new transfer with much improved sound the better to show off its pioneering music and effects track most everything here looks extremely good and one particular standout is murnaus rarely seen followup to sunrise the rural drama city girl  with farrell and mary duncan  long available only in soft millimeter prints  city girl here possesses a contrast and detail that suggest a pristine millimeter source and perhaps the dramatically improved image quality will contribute to the rehabilitation of what has long been murnaus most underrated film  altogether murnau borzage and fox represents the best that home video has to offer in quality scholarship and enduring aesthetic interest this is not a set that anyone will exhaust soon th century fox home entertainment  not rated'

VG.M.'s Pension Fund Stays Afloat, Against the Odds
p147

S'when general motors left washington emptyhanded last week among the lingering questions was whether its huge pension fund could topple and crush the governments pension insurance program the new york timess mary williams walsh writes when any pension fund fails usually as part of a bankruptcy the government takes over its assets as well as its payments to retirees in gms case its plan would dwarf the nations pension insurance fund still gm appears to have enough money in the pension fund to pay its more than  retirees their benefits for many years  even with the markets swooning around it that is largely because of the conservative way gm has managed the fund recently and it explains why gm has not joined the long list of companies pressing congress for pension relief but this glimmer of hope in a bleak auto landscape could change drastically particularly if gm struggles along for a few more years only to go bankrupt the companys bluecollar work force is still building up new benefits with every additional hour worked and the pension fund will have to grow smartly to keep up with those costs if gm continues paying people to retire early the costs will grow even more because the plan will have to pay retirees for more years than it budgeted and gm is not contributing additional money to the plan right now already gm says it will be paying retirees about  billion a year for the next  years the funds assets were worth  billion at the end of  more than enough to cover its obligations of  billion since then the assets have declined and the obligations have grown each by undisclosed amounts the company says it does not plan to add any money to the fund for the next three or four years even if gm were forced into bankruptcy the government might insist that it keep the fund and cover any shortfalls with its own money we would maintain that it can afford to keep its plan intact charles e f millard director of the pension benefit guaranty corporation the federal agency that takes over failed plans told the times based on past history we think that argument has a reasonable chance of success whatever its ultimate fate the gm fund may illustrate against the odds that it is still possible to offer traditional definedbenefit pensions even in a historic bear market the other american automakers chrysler and the ford motor company also operate pension funds ford said that its fund which is about half the size of gms had a small surplus at the end of  since then however it is thought to have suffered a bigger percentage of losses than gms fund because it uses a different investment strategy little is known about the chrysler pension fund today because the company stopped making mandatory pension disclosures when it was taken private in august  along with pensions gm has promised to provide health care to retirees but those medical benefits are not guaranteed by the federal government the total cost of these benefits in todays dollars was estimated at  billion at the end of  and gm had set aside only about  billion to cover the cost that year gm and the united automobile workers agreed to let gm cap its health obligations to retirees by creating a separate entity to manage the retiree health plan and making a big payment the automaker has said it will make the payment in january  and its retiree health obligations will end then in the meantime gm has issued securities to cover part of the cost and is holding them in a subsidiary created for that purpose the gm pension is viable today because of the companys response to the firestorm at the beginning of this decade said nancy c everett chief executive of gm asset management the unit manages the companys domestic and foreign pension funds as well as other big pools of company money in the two years after the tech crash of  most american pension funds suffered their worst squeeze ever although the stock market swings are even more severe now pension funds have been buffered somewhat by relief provisions written into the pension law signed in  at the time of the tech crash most pension funds had invested heavily in stocks and stocks lost billions of dollars in value at the same time interest rates fell to unusually low levels causing a painful mismatch because low rates make retirees benefits more expensive for pension funds to pay gms pension fund finished  with a shortfall of almost  billion by far the biggest of any american company  that was the genesis of general motors thinking differently about how to manage the fund  ms everett who was running the virginia state employees pension fund at the time told the times she joined gm in  until then most pension officials thought stocks were their best choice because stocks were expected to generate more over the long run than bonds and pension funds were thought to have a long time horizon stocks have also been a favorite pension investment because of a muchcriticized accounting rule that rewards the corporate bottom line when pension managers invest more aggressively the big mismatch of  showed pension officials that stocks could produce more volatility than a mature pension fund like gms could bear the company could not wait for stock prices to come back up eventually because it had  retirees waiting to be paid about  billion every year with that in mind gm sold more than  billion of bonds in  and put the proceeds into its pension fund making up for the preceding years losses it also put in the proceeds of the sale of its hughes electronics subsidiary for a total contribution of more than  billion that was far more than the minimum required that year the big contributions got rid of the funds shortfall they also gave gms bottom line a lift thanks to the accounting rule then over several years gm overhauled its investment portfolio replacing billions of dollars worth of stocks with bonds and adding derivatives to make the duration of the bonds better match the schedule of payments to retirees bond prices can swing too but gm plans to hold the bonds for their interest not sell them ms everett said the company believed the interest payments would be more than enough to produce the  billion owed to retirees every year currently  percent of gms pension fund is invested in stocks  well below the typical pension funds allocation david zion an analyst at credit suisse who tracks corporate pension funds closely estimates that gms pension assets have declined by about  percent so far this year compared with a  percent decline for the typical pension fund at americas  largest companies it will be several more months before the size of the losses is known for sure because companies disclose precise pension numbers just once a year when asked why gm did not eliminate stocks from its pension fund completely ms everett cited the controversial accounting rule theres two sides to this issue she told the times one is making sure your pension fund is adequately funded and the other is that pension income does come into play when youre looking at the companys income statement no company is eager to eliminate pension income if competitors still have theirs the financial accounting standards board has been working on revisions to keep pension activity from affecting the corporate bottom line but it is not finished yet gm has a free pass on the funding rules for the next few years it holds a socalled credit balance  a running tally of the contributions made in past years that were larger than the law required in  gms credit balance was worth  billion the company is using that balance to offset contributions it would otherwise have to make over time the size of the credit balance will fall ms everett said modeling exercises showed that a  percent allocation to equities was the likeliest way to produce adequate investment returns while also preserving the pension funds surplus she said managing the surplus was her top priority if gm had to make a pension contribution it would not have the cash on hand to do it the company has said it will run out of cash early next year meanwhile the cost of restructuring the company could put a heavy burden on the pension fund gms contract with the uaw offers special benefits to workers whose plants are shut down or who are forced to retire early invoking these special benefits could make the plans obligations soar  go to article from the new york times '

S'from the valley comes a warning sun microsystems in santa clara calif announced  layoffs on friday   maybe it was the tombstone that did it even as wall street burned silicon valley seemed strangely sanguine then a powerpoint presentation from sequoia capital prophesying armageddon  featuring an rip good times headstone  made the rounds a month later venture capital firms are slashing investments and counseling portfolio companies to cut jobs sequoias warning may reflect the technology industrys woes but its more notable for what it says about venture capital  maybe its because venture capitals traditional gravy train  initial public offerings of fastgrowing startups   had slowed that coupled with the severity of the  dotcom crash gave the industry a false sense of immunity to financial hard times  then came the sequoia document the firm  which had financed apple google and yahoo  showed its portfolio companies a presentation on why this financial crisis could be the worst yet and advised survival tactics like layoffs  the presentation burned across silicon valley like wildfire when one of the most successful firms moves in a club known for herdlike behavior everyone takes notice other investors like benchmark capital advised their companies to conserve cash layoffs began en masse  sequoiabacked linkedin and zappos both chopped their staffs as have big public companies like yahoo and sun microsystems since the sequoia presentation in october there have been nearly  layoffs in the technology sector according to a running counter on the blog techcrunch sequoias viral hit underscores the precariousness of the venture capital business venturebacked exits have fallen  percent so far this year and with the ipo market shut that has left mergers and acquisitions as the primary value driver yet with financing near impossible even the historical safety of being swallowed by a cisco or google has disappeared like wall street banks hedge funds and private equity the venture capital industry got too fat firms currently manage  billion according to the national venture capital association  percent more than during the bubble and the industry now raises more money than it creates a shakeout was inevitable its just odd that it took sequoias powerpoint to get it under way a  pension portfolio   no wonder private equity hedge fund and venture

S'                    from the valley                             comes a warning                             maybe it was the tombstone that did it even as wall street burned silicon valley seemed strangely sanguine then a powerpoint presentation from sequoia capital prophesying armageddon  featuring an rip good times headstone  made the rounds a month later venture capital firms are slashing investments and counseling portfolio companies to cut jobs sequoias warning may reflect the technology industrys woes but its more notable for what it says about venture capital                             maybe its because venture capitals traditional gravy train  initial public offerings of fastgrowing startups   had slowed that coupled with the severity of the  dotcom crash gave the industry a false sense of immunity to financial hard times                             then came the sequoia document the firm  which had financed apple google and yahoo  showed its portfolio companies a presentation on why this financial crisis could be the worst yet and advised survival tactics like layoffs                             the presentation burned across silicon valley like wildfire when one of the most successful firms moves in a club known for herdlike behavior everyone takes notice other investors like benchmark capital advised their companies to conserve cash layoffs began en masse                             sequoiabacked linkedin and zappos both chopped their staffs as have big public companies like yahoo and sun microsystems since the sequoia presentation in october there have been nearly  layoffs in the technology sector according to a running counter on the blog techcrunch                             sequoias viral hit underscores the precariousness of the venture capital business venturebacked exits have fallen  percent so far this year and with the ipo market shut that has left mergers and acquisitions as the primary value driver yet with financing near impossible even the historical safety of being swallowed by a cisco or google has disappeared                             like wall street banks hedge funds and private equity the venture capital industry got too fat firms currently manage  billion according to the national venture capital association  percent more than during the bubble and the industry now raises more money than it creates a shakeout was inevitable its just odd that it took sequoias powerpoint to get it under way                             a  pension portfolio                             no wonder private equity hedge

S'                    the wildest month in the history of wall street ended on halloween with both scary and thrilling price movements                             october was the worst month for the standard  poors index of  stocks in  years  since the  stock market crash                             but the final week was the best week for the market in  years                             as befits such a wild month it was the most volatile in the year history of the s p                              the huge gains of the final week were reminiscent of the sharp recoveries from bear market lows in  and  both of those moves came while the economy was mired in recession as it almost certainly is now                             if mondays stock market lows prove to be the low prices for this cycle the bear market will have ended with the s p  down  percent from the peak it reached in october                              that would make the bear market almost but not quite as bad as the  bear market which ended with the index down  percent                             in the  bear market the fall was  percent                             the hectic market action in october spread across most of the globe remarkably the american market was one of the calmer markets during the month several had more volatility and larger swings in prices                             nor was the volatility limited to stock prices oil prices fell  percent during october making this the worst month for that market since oil futures began trading in  oil is down to just under  a barrel from a peak over  in july                             one volatility measure shown in the accompanying charts is the number of days in which an index closes up or down at least  percent                             in normal times the market goes years without having even one such day there were none for instance from  through  there were three such days throughout the s and two in the s                             in october there were nine such days                             the accompanying chart shows the months from  through the present when the s p  had at least five days with  percent moves most of them were during the  crash and the great depression                             until now september  held the record for the most days with big moves at eight                             two days during october ended with the index leaping more than  percent something that had happened only nine times in the previous  years                             for the week the s p  was up  percent the best weekly gain since a  percent rise in the week that ended oct                               if the rebound this week indicated that the bear market of  had ended it lasted just over a year and hit bottom on monday at  it recovered to  by weeks end                             there were similar moves in most major indexes the dow jones industrial average ended the week up  percent at  and the nasdaq composite climbed  percent to                              for the month the s p  was still down  percent the worst showing for the index since it fell  percent in october  the dow fell  percent and the nasdaq index lost  percent                             both moves  weekly and monthly  affected every sector and nearly every stock only seven of the stocks in the s p  fell this week while just nine were up for the month                             of the  stocks in the dow industrials only one fell this week general motors dropped  cents to  amid talks on a possible merger with chrysler and additional government aid                             for the month all  were down with alcoa turning in the worst performance with a decline of  percent but in the final week it rose  percent ending at  after trading as low as  and as high as  during the month it traded at more than  last year                             during the bear market financial stocks led the way down the s p financial index fell  percent from the high it reached in early  to the low close on monday by friday the index had recovered  percent                             internationally russia led the volatility parade with an astonishing  days with  percent moves in the micex index it might have had more if russia had not closed the market on oct  fearful of the selling panic that was sweeping the world                             that index ended the week up  percent for the month it was still down  percent                             many countries among them britain japan india and brazil also showed more volatility than the united states                             that volatility was so high everywhere was an indication of how linked markets have become in the age of globalization it is not just that most industrial countries appear to be in recession or close to it another factor is that investors now own portfolios of shares from around the globe and in times of stress may sell what they can instead of just what they want to unload                             the period from  through   when there were no daily moves of at least  percent in the united states  became known as the great moderation to some economists that very lack of volatility encouraged investors to take more risks by borrowing money and encouraged others to lend it                             all of the big days in september and october came after lehman brothers was allowed to fail that lehman was not deemed important enough to save signaled to investors that there was risk where they thought there was none and caused a sharp tightening of credit for many borrowers despite efforts by central banks to push interest rates down                             the big advances on oct  and again on tuesday came as hope grew that the financial system would be protected the first came on the monday after the group of  finance ministers promised to take steps to protect banks this weeks big move came amid indications that central banks would aggressively cut interest rates                             such wild volatility may be an indication that a bottom was reached the biggest week since world war ii did come at the end of the  bear market and the biggest week in the s a gain of  percent came just after prices hit bottom on aug                               or the wild moves could just show how baffled investors are by a series of events unlike any they can remember                             charts record volatility in the us stock market months when daily closes of the s p

VIn the history of hip-hop, for both practical and aesthetic reasons, the music started as recordings. Beats and hooks on vinyl were transformed by disc jockeys, who set off the experimentation and technological escalation that make most current hip-hop a computerized playground of programmed beats and samples -- some repetitious, many ingenious. But there are some things that only live musicians can do onstage, and the Roots -- the long-running Philadelphia hip-hop band -- were proud to flaunt them during their headlining set at Roseland on Tuesday night. They shared the bill with Gym Class Heroes, another group that backs rapping with a live band. (Estelle, the opening act, returned to sing with both bands.)

S'in the history of hiphop for both practical and aesthetic reasons the music started as recordings beats and hooks on vinyl were transformed by disc jockeys who set off the experimentation and technological escalation that make  most current hiphop a computerized playground of programmed beats and samples  some repetitious many ingenious  from left foreground kirk douglas damon bryson and owen biddle of the roots playing a triple bill at roseland  but there are some things that only live musicians can do onstage and the roots  the longrunning philadelphia hiphop band  were proud to flaunt them during their headlining set at roseland on tuesday night they shared the bill with gym class heroes another group that backs rapping with a live band estelle the opening act returned to sing with both bands in song after song the roots demonstrated the kind of dynamics and speed shifts that cant be duplicated with a volume knob or a tempo control their  set started with their sousaphone player  damon bryson a k a tuba gooding jr parading onstage with a riff varied every time he played it soon backed up by a snappy new orleans secondline beat from ahmir thompson better known as uestlove  on drums and then the whole band  they wrapped a jazzy jam around the songs rising up and rising down from the roots most recent album rising down def jam changing attack for a guest verse by the rapper dice raw through the set black thought the lead rapper unpredictably shifted his delivery from declaration to whisper slowing down and speeding up with the band following every swerve there were other guests later mos def and qtip who performed his own song getting up  the roots flexibility signified both solidarity and openness the teamwork within the band its connections to styles from rock to reggae to swing and its determination to speak to every listeners tastes from oldschool hiphop to heavymetal shredding from the guitarist kirk douglas  black thoughts hyperarticulate rhymes brag accurately about his skills touch down in his home neighborhood in philadelphia and confront broad political questions from global warming to financial crisis criminal a song from rising down with a nigerianstyle afrobeat groove had new lyrics about the stock market crash and a chant naming george w bush john mccain sarah palin and the first dude as criminals  but politics is just one thing swept up in the roots grooves the physical nondigital presence of a working band onstage brings a visceral joy and the roots revel in their stamina at the end of their set the tireless black thought rocketed into a version of an old hiphop song men at work by kool g rap and dj polo let the record spin he rapped without a turntable in sight  gym class heroes come up with a different mixture of rap and band formed by high school friends upstate in geneva ny theyre cheerfully undecided among hiphop rock and reggae the lead vocalist travis mccoy raps most of the time but also sings and many of the bands newer songs are constructed like neat pop or new wave tunes with pop choruses and touches of the beatles  among the bands mentors are the poppunk standard bearers fall out boy whose singer patrick stump produced much of the gym class heroes new album  the quilt decaydance fueled by ramen taxi driver the sets penultimate song assembled the story of a romance from band names like bright eyes and at the drivein  where the roots concerns are global mr mccoys are local and personal his own ambitions and even more often whats going on with his girlfriends in gorounds of affection and betrayal hes genial about loves ups and downs sometimes its her fault sometimes its his because he cant keep my hands out of the cookie jar either way the music comes up bouncy and eager to please'

VFinancial Turmoil Threatens Biotech's Cash

S'so many biotechnology companies talk about extending the runway these days you might think they had entered the airline business the new york timess andrew pollack writes but for them runway refers to the time before a company runs out of money and with financial markets in turmoil the runways are looking dangerously short for many small biotechnology companies a biotech crash if it comes could threaten an industry that plays a vital role in turning scientific advances into usable medicines if you imagine a plane falling slowly to earth the financial crisis just tipped the nose straight down andrew baum chief executive of sembiosys genetics in calgary alberta whose stock trades on the toronto exchange told the times  sembiosys which hopes to use genetically engineered safflowers as a lowcost way to produce insulin and other drugs said last week it would cut about  workers or more than  percent of its work force even so the companys cash might last only until the middle of next year mr baum said many other biotechnology companies are starting to cut their work forces and even eliminate research and drug development projects in a desperate effort to extend the runway some might have to sell themselves at a bargain price like avalon pharmaceuticals did tuesday to clinical data for  million in stock the problem is that newly riskaverse investors are shunning biotechnology stocks which are among the riskiest investments around because most experimental drugs fail biotech companies accounted for  or  percent of the  companies that as of oct  were in danger of being delisted by nasdaq because their share price was less than  or they failed to have an adequate market valuation there are exceptions of course the big biotechnology companies including genentech and amgen have products on the market and are highly profitable the biggest companies are in such strong financial shape in fact that their shares are roughly flat for the year far better than stocks as a whole but most biotechnology companies  several hundred publicly traded ones and thousands more in private hands  are unprofitable and can sustain themselves only with periodic infusions of cash from willing investors or pharmaceutical companies it can take hundreds of millions of dollars and  years or longer to bring a drug to market for a biotech company cash is a raw material george milstein head of investment banking at pacific growth equities an investment bank specializing in health care told the times some  biotechnology companies up from  in the first quarter now have less than a year of cash at their current spending rates according to rodman  renshaw an investment bank that is about onethird of the publicly traded biotech companies it tracks lack of access to credit is not the main problem for small biotechnology companies which are considered so risky that even in boom times they cannot borrow much money from banks for biotechnology companies the main impact of the credit crisis involves the broader market some hedge funds have pulled out of biotechnology investing while others have had to sell shares to cover losses elsewhere or to return money to their investors to be sure the industry has been through funding droughts before such as in  and again in  and most companies survive but this crisis comes as other factors were already souring investors on biotechnology drug development has become longer and more costly in part because the food and drug administration has become more demanding and there is more pressure to cut drug prices so far this year public and private biotechnology companies have raised  billion according to the publishing company fdcwindhovers strategic transactions database that is only onethird the amount in all of  and likely to be the lowest amount since   it has been virtually impossible for biotech companies to go public this year that deprives venture capitalists who help start and nurture small companies of one of the main ways of realizing a return on their investment and it means they have to keep financing their companies longer those factors  plus the fact that some venture capitalists are investing in publicly traded biotechnology companies because their shares have become so cheap  mean there will be less money left for starting new companies when investors do invest they are more often insisting on quick returns robert i blum chief executive of cytokinetics a publicly traded company based in south san francisco calif said hedge funds had constantly pressed him to spend money only on the companys drugs that were already in clinical trials and to abandon earlierstage research aimed at finding new drugs they were challenging us and critiquing us for still investing in research mr blum told the times he said such pressure threatened to dry up innovation cytokinetics partially bowed to the pressure in september cutting some of its early research and dismissing  employees or  percent of its work force as a companys cash and stock price diminish raising money becomes even harder companies do not like to sell new stock cheaply because it dilutes existing shareholders and potential new investors sensing a company is desperate drive a harder bargain so do pharmaceutical companies which are desperate for new drugs and have the cash to buy smaller biotechnology companies i have a sense that big pharma is sitting on the sidelines waiting for them to hit bottom dennis purcell senior managing partner of aisling capital a lifesciences investment firm told the times fundraising would also get harder if nasdaq carried through on its threat to delist biotech companies that have become penny stocks but with so many companies in various industries in trouble nasdaq has now suspended enforcement of its delisting rules for three months until jan  some companies are managing to get money phenomix a san diego company put off trying to go public but licensed a diabetes drug to forest laboratories for an initial payment of  million ista pharmaceuticals of irvine calif got a  million credit line from deerfield management and two other shareholders but risk aversion is spreading even to some companies not in immediate danger of running out of cash despite having about  million on hand maxygen last week suspended work on its lead drug  aimed at protecting cancer chemotherapy patients from infections  rather than commit  million or so to move the drug through clinical trials the company based in redwood city calif said it would reduce its work force by  percent and would explore selling itself russell howard the chief executive said the companys market valuation was only about  million that is less than its cash on hand meaning investors were placing no value on the drug or any of the companys other programs why would you be investing more in this business he said if the market doesnt care  go to article from the new

S'this blog was filed during the day today with the first posts at the bottom the american market ended the day down about  making it one of the best performers in the world   pm  a fall fall october has one week left after today and i would not dream of forecasting it but in the unlikely event that prices do not move from todays closing levels here is how septemberoctober will rank on the list of worst twomonth periods for us stock indexes dow jones industrials  to   aprilmay  down  marchapril  down  octobernovember  down  octobernovember  down  augustseptember  down  septemberoctober  down  septemberoctober  down  novemberdecember  down  aprilmay  down  septemberoctober  down  standard  poors   aprilmay  down  septemberoctober  down  marchapril  down  augustseptember  down  octobernovember  down  septemberoctober  down  mayjune  down  aprilmay  down  septemberoctober  down  septemberoctober  down  nasdaq composite  septemberoctober  down  februarymarch  down  octobernovember  down  octobernovember  down  septemberoctober  down  novemberdecember  down  augustseptember  down  aprilmay  down  augustseptember  down  julyaugust  down  looking at those lists gives me some comfort  are these two months really comparable to the depression periods of  and  or to the crash months of   will the economy do as badly as it did then  is the threat to civilization comparable to the spring of  when germany conquered western europe is the current period really worse for nasdaq companies than the bursting of the tech bubble in  and  if the answer to those questions is no then perhaps the selling is overdone  pm  gaining ground with  minutes left the stock market is near the top of its daily range with the major indexes down less than   if that holds it could set a decent tone for the weekend discussions on what else if anything authorities should do  pm  losing money in washington the head of the pension benefit guaranty corporation was called to testify before a congressional committee today about the decision to put more of the agencys money into stocks  as i wrote in august doing that enabled the agency to assume it would make money in the stocks and thus get out of the deficit it faced the explanation for the strategy offered then is memorable  what were doing here is literally less risky charles e f millard the director of the guaranty corporation told me this week or as he put it in an article for pensions and benefit daily a trade publication the two most important facts about the new investment policy are that it significantly improves the probability the pbgc will be able to meet its obligations and that it does so while taking less shortterm and longterm risk    zvi bodie a finance professor at boston university who served as a consultant to the pbgc and helped write the old policy says the fundamental flaw in a heavy reliance on stocks is that it is precisely a fall in the value of the american stock market that the agency is insuring against not only do pension funds own a lot of stocks  and become more likely to fail if share prices plunge  but the backup guarantee of a pension fund is the value of the equity of the company that established the pension plan mr bodie never one for understatement compares the pbgc relying on stocks with an insurance company investing the proceeds from hurricane insurance premiums in florida real estate today the house education and labor committee released documents showing the agency lost  billion on stocks in the fiscal year that ended sept   you can bet they did not make up those losses this month with the current market turmoil we have to ask the question whether it is wise to invest our nations pension backstop in volatile equities said representative george miller the committee chairman  where was he when the new policy was being adopted maybe it is too late for the agency to sell a lot of stocks but mr millards claims that buying stocks reduced risks seems even less reasonable than it did in august  pm  close em down nouriel roubini the new york university economist who had sounded warnings for years suggested at a conference in madrid today that  governments would have to take over more financial institutions and run them not just invest in them before this is over he also said it might be necessary to close down financial markets for a week while governments take strong action to restore confidence  im not sure why he thinks they can do that heaven knows they have tried to restore confidence in every way they could think of   pm  bail out the governmentbacked takeover of national city the cleveland bank by pnc calls for shareholders to receive  per share well under thursdays market price of  and a tenth of what the bank was trading for a year ago i dont know if pnc is getting a good or bad deal but this takeover provides no support for share prices of other troubled banks  at  least from this example the treasury is not going to allow owners of those banks to be very well treated  pm  slipping back european markets closed well above their lows but now the american market is slipping back with both the dow and the sp down  percent for the day it is good to know that some officials have time to worry about other things nicolas sarkozy the french president has asked a court to enforce the presidents exclusive right to his image   bloomberg news reports the president wants a company to stop selling voodoo kits complete with a sarkozy doll and needles the unauthorized use of his image on a voodoo doll destined to be pricked with pins cannot be justified says mr sarkozys lawyer if the president wins the suit the company will have an inventory of voodoo dolls it cannot sell in france if it decided to export them to this country they would have to be revamped since mr sarkozy is not that well known or despised here lets give the company some help whose image would you most like to see on a voodoo doll  am  growls from the bear cave the jerome levy forecasting center of mt kisco ny has been among the most worried  and therefore most accurate  forecasters over the past several years they are out with a new forecast which is a combination of told ya and you aint seen nothing yet excerpts our view of the next  months no longer appears to be unconventional at least not on the surface now everybody thinks the economy is in a recession and many think it will be long and severe people make comparisons to the s all the time everyone thinks consumer spending is in big trouble lots of people think the fed will ease financial instability a theme we harped on ad nauseam during the past three years is now the primary economic topic of discussion  still conventional wisdom leaves out much that is important about the economic situation and it encompasses much that is wrong      most investors businesses and analysts despite their deep pessimism about the consumer outlook will be surprised by the length and severity of the consumer pullback  the public is starting to discover the seriousness of the state and local fiscal position but the magnitude and fallout of the developing nonfederal government crisis will prove shocking  many fear that the present financial mess is setting the stage for surging treasury yields and most will be surprised by how low yields will fall    house prices will probably fall another      the emerging market sector of the global economy is facing more than a financial crisis it is facing a depression which unfortunately is likely to be uncontained and severe in many countries    lending is not going to be fixed by recapitalizing banks the underlying problem is not just that aggregate private loans are too large relative to bank capital it is that they are too large relative to aggregate private income thus the problem is with the borrowers not just the lenders and households need to lower their debt relative to income while corporations need to lower their debt relative to revenue    even if the recession does end before  employment will continue to decline it is likely to fall for another year or two as downsizing and restructuring persist the unemployment rate is likely to reach  by the end of  and will be near  before it reverses lets hope they are wrong this time note this item previously said the levy center was part of bard college where hy minsky used to teach that used to be true but they are no longer connected  am  rally the dow is down less than  points for the day which means it is up  points from the low    am  winners and losers there are two companies in the sp  that are up a bit today emc the storage company and mastercard   the bottom  in the group all down  percent or more are mostly energy or financial companies i havent mentioned today that oil is down despite opecs promise to cut production so is more or less every other commodity they are from the bottom up aig national oilwell schlumberger morgan stanley aes sprint nextel merrill lynch united health conocophillips and weyerhaeuser  am  support markets in europe and the united states are off their lows and there does not seem to be panic selling going on  american indexes are down around  percent which is better than europe or asia  am  opacity and worry a reader asks the following in the comments below how much further do we have to slide to unwind the derivatives market is this essentially the same as your comment on getting hedge funds out my reading says that the worse things get for the markets the bigger the derivatives bubble keeps growing if all the undercapitalized tranches cdos cdss etc were called today i understand that the bubble is over  trillion i cant imagine how we get out of that one unless there is a dramatic unexpected turnaround for god knows what reason in valuations of these assets those are good questions and i do not have good answers  the derivatives and hedge fund industries managed to keep so much out of public sight that we now can only guess the  trillion figure represents notional value i assume such numbers are wildly overstated because many derivatives have maximum losses or gains far below the notional value moreover in the world of derivatives  unlike the worlds of stocks and bonds and cdos  there are no net losses  your loss is someone elses profit  but with all the opacity it is tempting to suspect that everyone is holding losses  am  news from the art world sothebys filed the following with the sec late yesterday in october  the company held an autumn sales series in hong kong and a sale of contemporary art in london the aggregate amount of auction guarantees related to property offered at these sales was approximately  million as a result of certain of the guaranteed property failing to sell or selling for less than the minimum guaranteed price the company incurred a principal loss of approximately  million pretax the company will recognize this loss in the third quarter of  as these auction guarantees were outstanding as of september   as a result of the guaranteed property that failed to sell in these auctions the company will own inventory currently valued at approximately  million which had an original midestimate sale price of approximately  million  subsequent to the hong kong and london sales discussed above and as of october   the company had outstanding auction guarantees totaling  million the companys financial exposure under these auction guarantees is reduced by  million as a result of risk sharing arrangements with unaffiliated partners substantially all of the property related to such auction guarantees is being offered at auctions in the fourth quarter of  as of october    million of the guaranteed amount had been advanced by the company  the companys current financial exposure under auction guarantees represents a  reduction from one year ago in light of the current uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets the company expects to continue to substantially reduce its use of auction guarantees until stability is restored in the global economy and financial markets  guaranteeing that prices will not fall appears to be a poor decision in almost every market these days  am  october blues here are some october performances through a few minutes ago in each case i took a major index from the country in question  all figures are in us dollars us down canada down mexico down argentina down brazil down chile down peru down  britain down germany down france down switzerland down italy down ireland down iceland down netherlands down belgium down denmark down finland down greece down poland down czech republic down russia down hungary down lithuania down turkey down south africa down israel down  japan down hong kong down china down taiwan down south korea down australia down new zealand down india down singapore down  the variance is not that great with the exception of poor iceland and remember that prices were way down from last year before october began you will note that the united states is among the best performers dont you feel better now  am  more home sales the national association of realtors announced that existing home sales rose last month  but no one thinks that is good news it appears the sales are being driven by desperate sellers not venturesome buyers the funny mortgages of yesteryear are forcing people out of their homes  am  why here are two hypotheses on what is happening  the world is finally waking up to just how bad it is and that earnings are going to fall everywhere  only a couple of weeks ago some people were claiming the sp  was trading at  times the next years earnings even if it was around  times trailing earnings  if that is the problem then this could be nearing an end and this panic could really mark the bottom  fair warning ive spotted bottoms before during this bust and been ever so wrong  this is the hedge fund devastation as overleveraged hedge funds are forced to sell by falling prices and then are forced to sell more because they drive prices even lower   there are rumors around that the fed is liquidating one hedge fund there are also denials so i wont name the fund  but even if the rumor is false it encapsulates one big worry if that is the explanation this will end when the hedge funds have finally been forced out then the rise could be explosive meanwhile share prices are up from a few minutes ago  down  on the dow seems like good news  am  world not over the dow is down  points now but is is more or less stable at that level  that is a much smaller loss than they have in europe and japan today is there buying support coming in  we can hope  am  rate cuts coming will central banks cut rates again the lead if it is to happen needs to come from the places where rates are highest in europe  it is midafternoon in london and frankfurt   that is one obvious thing to try  but everyone knows that central bank easing is not spreading to those who need credit the most how reassuring would it be   am  circuit breakers not to seem negative but here is what it would take to halt the stock exchange after it opens these are the current version of the circuit breaker rules that were passed after the  crash a point drop in the djia before  pm would halt trading for one hour the halt would be  minutes if the number were hit between  pm and  pm after that  points would not be enough to halt trading a point drop in the djia before  pm will halt trading for two hours it would halt trading for one hour if it came between  pm and  pm and would end trading for the day if it came after  pm a point drop would halt trading for the remainder of the day no matter when it happened   am  general electric seeks cash  it was yesterday that general electric said it would borrow through the federal reserves new credit facility when it opens for business next week bloomberg quotes a ge spokesman as follows this is our way to demonstrate our support for what the fed is doing which is providing all around liquidity he may have had it backwards this is the fed supporting companies   it would have been more reassuring if mighty ge were confident it did not need government support to borrow money   am  british recessionthe rout was already under way when britain announced today that its economy was shrinking during the third quarter of the year so we cant blame this on the brits nonetheless the fact the decline in gdp was worse than expected helped to set the tone one part of the problem became clear when alistair darling the chancellor of the exchequer  britains fancy name for finance minister  spoke to a television interviewer for sky news we are determined to do everything we can and as soon as we can to help people he said weve got to work together the credit crunch is global you will note that he did not mention anything in specific that they would do  i doubt he has much idea of what he can do   am  un day the worlds markets are quaking more than i have ever seen today  stock index futures stopped trading in the united states this morning after they fell the daily limit for overnight trading that is  points for the dow futures and  for the sp futures the new york stock exchange has just said it will open for trading at  am as scheduled  the fact they think it is necessary to say that is hardly encouraging around the world already low share prices have been hammered japan was especially hard hit as toyota announced sales were down and other exporters said they were running into problems as well what is most scary about this is that it comes after the major industrial countries pulled out all the stops to try to bail out banks and get their financial systems running again what more tricks do they have available today is the rd anniversary of the founding of the united nations that date used to be celebrated  if we had made it a holiday around the world as some advocated at least this would not be happening today as it is the date seems somehow appropriate it was not that long ago that many were confident about decoupling in which the united states could falter but the rest of the worlds economies particularly those in developing countries could keep humming along   now it is clear we are all in this together  '

experienced the shortest downturns lasting about five years each  it may seem obvious but poorer more heavily minority communities where housing prices were already relatively low experienced less severe downturns  more affluent neighborhoods with a consistently high percentage of white residents where prices had been going up for some time tended to be harder hit in the downturns  the neighborhoods that gained the most ground in the s upturn were not necessarily the same neighborhoods that saw the greatest price appreciation in the most recent upturn  so it is difficult to predict how neighborhoods will fare based on what has happened in previous cycles as for this downturn it is too early to tell but we do know that prices appear to have peaked earlier in staten island than in the other boroughs  in staten island the prices of single family homes peaked in  and have been falling since then in contrast single family homes in queens and the bronx did not peak until  and prices for single family homes in brooklyn continued to rise throughout  jonathan j millergoing into the housing boom circa  there was significant new development activity in emerging manhattan neighborhoods aka gentrification that allowed buyers to obtain newly constructed units at significant discounts relative to prices in more established residential neighborhoods  as time passed the discount between prices in emerging and established neighborhoods reduced and price per square foot as a benchmark became somewhat homogenized across different markets and neighborhoods  in many ways i think there is no particular manhattan neighborhood that stands out as morerisk exposed than others right now  in the late s that question was much easier to answer lower east side east village harlem clinton and the financial district i believe to a certain degree the difference in price between neighborhoods is correlated to the risk of a downturn  it has been my experience in the past few cycles demand for real estate has expanded to emerging markets on the upswing only to return to center when the market weakens  however the protracted growth of sales and prices in this real estate cycle has allowed more time for residential support services to become established reducing the risk of the return to center phenomenon for many neighborhoods what upward pressures or even stabilizing effects on manhattan prices can you possibly imagine in the next  years  jonathan j miller i am having a hard time coming up with any rationale suggesting that some external market force would cause manhattan housing prices to rise over the next two years  and this assumes that liquidity in the mortgage market is restored  we are faced with rising unemployment and lower compensation in the financial services sector a national recession potentially higher mortgage rates caused by the bailout funding and a return to a prehousing boom mortgage underwriting mindset  if liquidity improves significantly over the next year and mortgages are cheaper and easier to come by then manhattan and perhaps many housing markets would see significant improvement in activity providing stabilization  however if we see a prolonged credit crunch it will simply serve to push inventory higher in most housing markets while bailout and other related situations are sorted out in washington  that excess inventory would need to be worked off before stabilization was to occur vicki been manhattan remains a unique and desirable real estate market in the us and the world  demand for manhattans housing stock has become increasingly insulated from larger housing market trends because of manhattans continued status as a trophy location  if crime stays low and the general quality of life remains high we would expect manhattans market to continue to defy national trends to some degree  that said no one knows the extent of the looming economic downturn or how effective the federal governments interventions will be  until we see that unfold we cannot predict how manhattans prices will fare    after the s bubble coops and condominiums got clobbered to a far greater extent than singlefamily homes the average onefamily home fell about onethird in value plus inflation but many coops and condos particularly outside manhattan were unsellable for years some of our friends had bought them i believe the reason is that the whole baby boom was moving out of the singles and couples phase and into the parenting phase while the smaller gen x group was moving away from home is it possible that given the different demographic situation suburban homes will suffer a greater decline in relative value this time  vicki been during the s there was a lot of overbuilding in the condo market nationwide due in part to tax treatment of investment housing and depreciation  further because the price bubble was bigger for condos than singlefamily homes we saw a bigger fall when the bubble burst for condos  today while there certainly has been a building boom in nyc in the past few years and many of the new condos have yet to come online we probably dont have as much excess supply as we did during the s downturn  the singlefamily housing market in nyc is much more constrained than the condo market in  for example only  of the citys new building permits were for single family homes so again wed expect to see less excess supply and therefore smaller drops in prices purchasers of single family homes are more likely to be owneroccupants not investors than purchasers of condos and may have a longer timehorizon for owning  when prices drop they are more likely to sit on the property and wait for prices to rebound whereas investors who own condos may try to sell and minimize their losses  that increases the supply of units for sale and depresses prices further the demographic shifts between cities and suburbs over the past few decades are complicated  but in addition to the demographic changes high gas prices may make homes in the far suburbs and exurbs become less attractive because they usually require longer commutes  also high home heating costs may reduce demand for larger houses jonathan j miller one of the reasons coops and condos saw a significant decline in values as you described is because a key driver of demand for these units was speculation  much of it was tax incentivized so the investment activity was promoted at taxpayers expense  to make matters worse many coop sponsors defaulted because they needed to continue to sell apartments to cover their negative cash flow on rentregulated apartments difference between monthly maintenance and rent  typically the lender who took back the project from the sponsor was forced to issue individual mortgages to apartment buyers because outside lenders would not  although many of the purchases were all cash   my favorite story on this situation occurred in the early s  i performed an appraisal of a small studio coop in a building where the sponsor defaulted  the purchase price was  and i remember thinking only for a moment i could buy that apartment with my credit card until i pondered the very real possibility that the coop corporation could collapse  it never did during the recent housing boom a trend toward new urbanism gained momentum newly constructed residential units were developed within long time commercial business districts  class c office buildings in commercial districts of many metro markets across the country were converted to residential use along with the creation of retail shopping and other residential support services eventually this change may place more stress on suburban housing markets  however i think i am more concerned about the exurbs those markets beyond the suburbs created in response to rapidly rising prices in urban and suburban markets their competitive price advantage has been weakened recently by lower pricing near the core   can you explain how do the current economic conditions compare to historical market downturns and how deep and long did those last  jonathan j miller when i think of historical market downturns my frame of reference is the  stock market crash and subsequent recession in   new york was hit hard and the housing market followed the economy  to the typical characterization but this time itll be different it may be different but in both positive and negative ways  the manhattan housing boom in the s was characterized by a rental to coop apartment conversion frenzy and a a tax abatement incentivized condo construction boom with emphasis on smaller investor apartments  when the music stopped in  marked by the  october drop in the dow the housing market was left with an absorption rate of about  months and  year mortgage rates were   coops were deemed the pariah of the housing market with many sponsor defaults bank foreclosures and speculative insider flips  condos werent much better off because of the revisions to federal tax laws in  that reduced the financial incentive for individual investors to purchase the newly constructed condo units that were flooding the market this time new york has been one of the last regions in the country to see weakness in housing  across the country housing helped lead the economy into recessionary conditions rather than the other way around  thats largely because the nation actually experienced a mortgage boom rather than a housing boom which was brought about by a complete lapse of regulatory oversight historically low mortgage rates and the disconnect by all parties including ratings agencies commercial banks investors wall street and borrowers over the relationship between risk and reward  but thats another story  despite all of this manhattan currently has modest inventory levels a  month absorption rate and new development added to the housing stock is largely expected to end next year due to elimination of condo development financing  during the boom coops did a better job vetting buyers than banks did and speculative activity represented less than  of all sales nearly  in miami and the weak dollar fostered a lot of foreign buyer demand  ironically wall street arguably one of the driving forces of mortgage securitization will impact the new york region with layoffs and lower bonus  apartment sales activity is already down by  year to date compared to  and price trends are leveling off after years of increases  foreign demand caused by the weak dollar is beginning to slow down as foreign economies are experiencing their own troubles   its pretty tough to forecast housing trends until the credit markets are at least stabilized  the proverbial cart before the horse  the scope of the problem is historic global and complicated  the drive to purchase real estate is still remarkably strong but that really means little at the moment until the credit situation is stabilized vicki been its impossible to predict just how bad market conditions will get during this downturn based on earlier downturns but to put our current situation in context its useful to take a look back at overall housing price trends in new york city over the last  years   prices for all housing types were mostly flat throughout the s but saw significant appreciation through most of the s topping out in   prices began to fall after  and continued to fall until the mids then slowly started to pick up again after   the condo market saw the biggest hit in that downturn with values dropping by  on average between  and  single family homes fell by  and  family homes fell by   after  initial growth was slow but the market really took off after  and continued to be strong through   for example  family properties increased by  on average between  and  and the prices of condos increased by  during this time period while much of the real estate world didnt begin talking about a downturn in new york until this year our repeat sales index which measures inflationadjusted price changes in the repeated sales of the same properties shows that prices in the outer boroughs generally peaked in  and have been declining since  manhattan properties in contrast generally continued to appreciate in  history thus tells us that recent downturns in new york have come on rather slowly and lasted for a number of years for each downturn weve witnessed some variability in how different neighborhoods and housing types are impacted so its unlikely that this downturn will have a uniform impact    i own  condos in harlem one of which i use as a rental property i intend to hold on to both properties for the next  years so a temporary decrease in housing values is not a big problem for me my question is will a decrease in housing value assuming there is one have any affect on the rental market if prices drop will the potential pool of renters decrease if property values drop do rental prices follow vicki been thats a great question with a complicated answer  its important to remember that in the short run a relatively small number of households are actively deciding whether to rent or own  the households who are most likely to be affected by a change in prices are new households moving into the region households within the region who have decided to move within the region because of a change in job or family status and some smaller segment of households who might be swayed by changes in the cost and availability of financing  in other words its unlikely that a drop in value will result in a sudden rush of buyers or renters changing homes  that said for those new yorkers who are looking for housing the decision to buy or rent depends both on the price of homes and the price of financing  although homes are now cheaper its more difficult to get a mortgage especially for households with weak credit histories so its not clear what the net effect on homeownership rates or on the pool of likely renters will be  another consideration is that in the current climate it also may be harder for developers and landlords to get financing and if that constrains the supply of new rental housing rents could increase as a result   its also important to remember that the new york city housing market is segmented by tenure renter versus owneroccupied geography and quality  a drop in housing prices in queens and brooklyn due to foreclosures will not necessarily attract renters from manhattan to purchase the foreclosed homes in the outer boroughs just how rental prices will respond will depend on what else is going on in individual neighborhoods  finally all of this will depend on how new york citys economy performs which could dampen demand for both rental and for sale properties  jonathan j miller this is a great question because conventional wisdom at least on the surface does not apply  one would expect to see rental prices trend in the opposite direction of sales activity  a widely perceived zero sum market  if people are not purchasing apartments they must be renting  however this is not the case  the rental market is much more responsive to employment conditions than sales activity is  employment is contracting with many more private sector jobs to be lost over the next year  the number of sales in manhattan is down sharply from the record period last year and prices are flattening  at the same time rents are slipping and the level of rental activity is lower than earlier this year  sales activity tends to lead price trends in theory falling prices lead to higher inventory which leads to more sales listings that become rental listings leading to declining rents from an increase in supply  in other words rental price trends could follow sales price trends if the market continues to weaken  i am looking to buy my first home two to three bedrooms in new jersey queens or brooklyn i have saved excellent down payment but need some morgage  should i wait or buy now if wait how long jonathan j miller in my  years in property appraisal experience i have yet to meet an individual who was particularly adept at timing the housing market yet this is a concern of most people that are looking to purchase  i am not a big believer in timing unless you are an investor looking for a quick turnover rather than a longer ownership window of  years you have an advantage over many first time buyers because you have a large down payment  one of the issues that is hurting first time buyers right now is the fact that lending institutions are now requiring larger payments as they had in the past which generally are  to  of the purchase price  during the mortgage boom  appeared to be the new norm and first time buyers flooded the market  the down payment was not an obstacle anymore  a better financial position now may give you an advantage over sellers in a market characterized by rising inventory  sellers are much more aware of the financial characteristics of buyers these days and bank underwriting requirements are much tougher than they were a few years ago  stronger personal financials may very well yield more leverage in negotiations with your seller'

S'following is the second set of answers from john steele gordon the author of an empire of wealth the epic history of american economic power answered selected readers questions about the history of wealth in new york through friday sorry we are no longer taking questions for this feature  what are the most striking similarities and differences between todays financial problems and those of the great depression  well the first big difference is that we are not in a depression let alone anything even remotely resembling the great depression the gdp fell by half in the great depression we have yet to experience a single quarter of negative growth unemployment was above  percent in  the current rate is  percent below the historic averageas in  we have had a slowing economy a severe credit crunch and a declining stock market although not a crash in the ordinary sense of a oneday huge fall on extraordinary volume it was government mistakes  especially keeping interest rates high and raising taxes  which turned an ordinary recession into the great depression we surely wont make those mistakes again and lets hope we dont make others   i have heard mentioned the  who were wealthy movers and shakers centered on the upper east side around the turn of the last century i would like to hear more about them  i think you mean the  the term was coined by ward mcallister a selfappointed arbiter of new yorks fashionable world in the late th century and was supposed to be the number of people who could be accommodated in mrs astors ballroom for her annual ball to be invited to mrs astors ball was to be automatically an accepted part of new york society to not be invited was a social disaster at least for the socially ambitious her house was where the empire state building is now along with another astor house belonging to a cousin between them was an empty lot one house was torn down to build the waldorf hotel and the other the astoria hotel the empty lot became peacock alley mrs astor moved tofifth avenue across from central park actually the  numbered about  as there was an irreducible number of people that simply had to be invited the phrase has connoted new york society ever since and forbes magazine took the number when it did its first richest americans list in   so much discussion of wealth in new york city focuses on manhattan neighborhoods especially the upper east and west sides could you say anything about when wealthy neighborhoods in other parts of the city like riverdale in the bronx came into existence  many of the wealthy neighborhoods in the other boroughs have been around quite as long as the wealthy manhattan neighborhoods and sometimes much longer the upper east side did not become fashionable until after the civil war riverdale became fashionable at about the same time after the hudson river railroad built a train station there by the s just as the fifth avenue mansions were beginning to be built across from central park riverdale became a suburban enclave of the rich  i am a fifth generation  brooklyn home boy who wants to know about the johnson family and there ownership of todd shipyards in brooklyn my mother and father are dead and gone but my father said they were relatives of ours and i want to know about there ownership of this shipyard what they built and anything else relevant can you help  not directly im afraid i would check various histories of brooklyn for information about shipyards there new york was one of the great shipbuilding centers of the world in the th century the famous yacht america was built at th street and the east river in  the uss monitor was built in greenpoint brooklyn as for your connections to the johnson family id suggest looking into it at the new york public librarys local history and genealogy room it has one of the worlds great collections of genealogical materials and very helpful librarians'

S'on monday for the first time this october the dow jones industrial average ended the day higher than it began nine hundred and thirtysix points higher to be exact making for the biggest singleday percentage gain in  years  two traders peter edelson left and james dresch on the floor of the new york stock exchange on monday   the surge came as governments and central banks around the world mounted an aggressive coordinated campaign to unlock the global flow of credit an effort that investors said they had been waiting for  some experts greeted the rally as a turning point in the slowmotion crash that has erased five years worth of value from the stock market in the last few weeks when monday began shares of some bluechip companies were at their cheapest levels in years  the market clearly was getting priced for an armageddon a depression for the end of western civilization as we know it said edward yardeni the investment strategist a lot of people realized these were extraordinarily good prices to buy stocks  but others warned that the problems at the center of the current crisis including a global credit squeeze and worsening economic conditions were far from solved and could set the stage for more volatility in markets  reeling from the worst week in stocks since  officials announced over the weekend that they would flood the financial system with billions of dollars in liquidity and provide capital for troubled banks throwing out the traditional financial playbook in favor of a series of moves that officials hoped would get banks lending again  relief poured through the markets the  percent gain in the broad standard  poors stock index was that gauges best singleday gain since  stocks in paris and frankfurt had their best singleday gains ever rising more than  percent the dow jones industrial average which closed at  up  percent is now back to its level on thursday only four times in its history has the dow risen more percentage points in a day those gains came in    and  but trading volume was lighter than last week meaning fewer investors jumped in to buy than were selling last week portions of the credit markets  which remained locked tight before the weekend  were closed for the columbus day holiday so investors may have had trouble gauging the reaction among banks and big lenders to the new global initiatives some analysts said that stock investors held off on their trades to see how the credit markets would react if the credit markets open up tomorrow and you cant see money flowing where its supposed to flow you imagine that this whole thing reverses itself quite dramatically said randy cass chief executive of first coverage a firm that collects and analyzes investment advice offered by brokerage firms  investors may also be eager to pocket their profits from mondays gains which could send stocks lower when the markets reopen tuesday there were signs on monday however that the coordinated government efforts had started to make some headway in loosening the flow of credit the cost to insure the debt of several major corporations fell significantly a sign that investors were more confident about the health of the nations big banks and businesses the seeds of the rally began on sunday afternoon after more than a dozen european countries  including britain france germany and spain  announced aggressive plans to guarantee loans take ownership stakes in banks or prop up ailing companies with billions in taxpayer funds  theres a mixture of surprise and relief certainly in europe as to the scale of the measures that have been announced since the weekend said mark cliffe chief economist of ing group there was considerable nervousness to say the least that the europeans wouldnt come through with a concerted effort and essentially they have  the treasury department followed suit on monday after wall street closed unveiling similar plans to take stakes in troubled companies and provide blanket insurance for deposits  the rescue efforts spurred rallies in stock markets around the world at midday on tuesday the hang seng index in hong kong was up nearly  percent and the australian s pasx  index in sydney had gained more than  percent the nikkei in tokyo which was closed monday for a national holiday had soared more than  percent at midday  at  am monday in new york one hour before the start of trading in europe the fed issued a statement saying it would make billions of dollars available to banks in coordination with the bank of england the european central bank and the swiss national bank it was the latest unprecedented move by the central bank effectively a pledge to provide unlimited liquidity to the worlds banking system as mr yardeni put it stocks in

VAsian stocks rose sharply again on Tuesday in the wake of global financial bailouts and the massive rally on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 led the way, climbing into double-digit gains. The market, closed for a national holiday on Monday, was catching up on the wave of relief that had already swept most other markets in the Asia Pacific region. By mid-morning, the Nikkei was up more than 13 percent at 9,355, reversing some of the 24 percent it had shed last week. Both the Standard and Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 index and the Kospi in South Korea extended their gains from Monday, adding about 4 percent. The Straits Times index in Taiwan, the only market in the region to have ended in the red on Monday, rose 5.4 percent, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong added to Monday's 10 percent rally by rising another 3 percent on Tuesday.

last week  both the standard and poorsaustralian stock exchange  index and the kospi in south korea extended their gains from monday adding about  percent the straits times index in taiwan the only market in the region to have ended in the red on monday rose  percent and the hang seng index in hong kong added to mondays  percent rally by rising another  percent on tuesday  the yen eased to  per dollar and government bond prices fell as investors left safehavens in search of opportunities in the stock markets the gains in japan followed a good day on wall street on monday for the first time this october the dow jones industrial average ended the day higher than it began nine hundred and thirtysix points higher to be exact making for the biggest singleday percentage gain in  years the surge came as governments and central banks around the world mounted an aggressive coordinated campaign to unlock the global flow of credit an effort that investors said they had been waiting for some experts greeted the rally as a turning point in the slowmotion crash that has erased five years worth of value from the stock market in the last few weeks when monday began shares of some bluechip companies were at their cheapest levels in years the market clearly was getting priced for an armageddon a depression for the end of western civilization as we know it said edward yardeni the investment strategist a lot of people realized these were extraordinarily good prices to buy stocks but others warned that the problems at the center of the current crisis including a global credit squeeze and worsening economic conditions were far from solved and could set the stage for more volatility in markets reeling from the worst week in stocks since  officials announced over the weekend that they would flood the financial system with billions of dollars in liquidity and provide capital for troubled banks throwing out the traditional financial playbook in favor of a series of moves that officials hoped would get banks lending again relief poured through the markets the  percent gain in the broad standard  poors stock index was that gauges best singleday gain since  stocks in paris and frankfurt had their best singleday gains ever rising more than  percent the dow jones industrial average which closed at  up  percent is now back to its level on thursday only four times in its history has the dow risen more percentage points in a day those gains came in    and  but trading volume was lighter than last week meaning fewer investors jumped in to buy than were selling last week portions of the credit markets  which remained locked tight before the weekend  were closed for the columbus day holiday so investors may have had trouble gauging the reaction among banks and big lenders to the new global initiatives some analysts said that stock investors held off on their trades to see how the credit markets would react if the credit markets open up tomorrow and you cant see money flowing where its supposed to flow you imagine that this whole thing reverses itself quite dramatically said randy cass chief executive of first coverage a firm that collects and analyzes investment advice offered by brokerage firms investors may also be eager to pocket their profits from mondays gains which could send stocks lower when the markets reopen tuesday there were signs on monday however that the coordinated government efforts had started to make some headway in loosening the flow of credit the cost to insure the debt of several major corporations fell significantly a sign that investors were more confident about the health of the nations big banks and businesses the seeds of the rally began on sunday afternoon after more than a dozen european countries  including britain france germany and spain  announced aggressive plans to guarantee loans take ownership stakes in banks or prop up ailing companies with billions in taxpayer funds theres a mixture of surprise and relief certainly in europe as to the scale of the measures that have been announced since the weekend said mark cliffe chief economist of ing group there was considerable nervousness to say the least that the europeans wouldnt come through with a concerted effort and essentially they have the treasury department followed suit on monday after wall street closed unveiling similar plans to take stakes in troubled companies and provide blanket insurance for deposits'

VMorgan Stanley's Tight Bind With Mitsubishi

S'updated mitsubishi ufj financial group is attempting to renegotiate its investment in morgan stanley the reason is economics on sept  mitsubishi agreed to buy  billion of preferred stock for a price of at least  a share but morgan closed at  a share on friday  and had traded even further down earlier in the day mitsubishis investment will be underwater from the start so the question is what rights does mitsubishi have to walk under the investor agreement according to morgan the necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained and the closing is scheduled to occur on tuesday there is no materiality out   in other words the representations and warranties have to be true and correct in all respects not in all material respects as is usual however morgan only makes a bare number of representations and warranties in the agreement the most important of these for providing a possible out to mitsubishi is that morgan represents that  no material adverse effect since august   and except as described in the sec reports no event or circumstance has occurred that individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect  this would be mitsubishis biggest and possibly only out right now  the ability to claim that since aug  morgan has suffered a material adverse effect otherwise known as a mac note however because morgan has likely disclosed to mitsubishi all of the adverse events which occurred to it prior to sept  the mac will likely be measured against any deterioration from the signing of the investor agreement on that date the investor agreement defines a material adverse effect to mean any fact circumstance event change effect or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate with all other facts circumstances events changes effects or occurrences has a material adverse effect on i the business assets liabilities results of operation or financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or ii the ability of the company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this agreement other than in each case any adverse effect resulting from the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this  agreement this is a buyerfriendly form of the clause it does not contain the large number of exclusions you typically see in these clauses most notably an exclusion from the mac definition for changes to stock prices and for general and industry economic conditions  however the investor agreement is governed by delaware law and delaware strictly construes mac clauses any adverse change must be longterm and durational to be a mac moreover it is unlikely that the delaware courts would find a simple stock decline of this nature to be a longterm and durational event without more occurring  this may indeed be happening but we dont know perhaps mitsubishi could claim asset withdrawals new information in morgans recently filed q or other significant deteriorations to the morgan business in the past week  however morgans dilemma is not new back in the crash of  jardine strategic holdings had agreed to purchase  percent of bear stearns for  million jardine claimed a mac had occurred based on trading losses by bear of  million and a  precipitous drop in bear stearns stock price from  to  or over  percent the new york supreme court ruling under new york law in bear stearns co v jardine strategic holdings no  slip op ny sup ct june  held that a trial was necessary to determine the meaning of the mac clause but also indicated that jardine should have understood that bear was in a volatile cyclical business and the loss and stock price decline could not be considered a mac  here mitsubishi would face the same uphill battle unless it could find a substantial and actual longterm deterioration in morgans business from when it agreed to make the investment sept  the agreement sets delaware as the nonexclusive forum for any litigation  but whether it is a new york or delaware court either is are likely to view mitsubishi as having bought into this volatility and crisis and mitsubishi will likely have to show a specific adverse event within morgan itself moreover you have to wonder about the cultural aspect here would the japanese want to risk being seen as ostensibly refusing to keep their promises   nonetheless mitsubishi faces a significant loss here and the parties are intent on entering into a longterm alliance there will be pressure on morgan to find a way to accommodate mitsubishi and mitsubishi will be under economic pressure to find a solution it is this economic incentive which may lead it to assert a mac to engender further the negotiation though the chances of winning without any further information seem low  a public mac assertion at this point would greatly hurt morgan  perhaps we are heading to a renegotiation where this equity investment is turned into a loan it seems likely that despite mitsubishis weak contractual position at least based on public knowledge the best course is some type of facesaving restructuring of the relationship  it strikes me that this would be a very opportune time for the treasury to make its first bank injection this could be a j p morgan moment  that is the treasury stepping in to make some facesaving sidebyside investment in morgan would be a clear sign of market confidence that we all need steven m davidoff'

the canadian dollar was down nearly  cents the biggest single day drop in the currencys history many analysts say the dollars decline over the past week stems from concerns of traders that the

global halt  am prime minister silvio berlusconi has raised the specter of an extraordinary halt from the associated press the idea of suspending the markets for the time it takes to rewrite the rules

urging a global approach to solving the crisis but they have so far struggled to agree on one  in that context it may be unsurprising that the white house appeared to be on a completely different page than the italian leader there are absolutely no plans or discussions to interfere with the functioning of markets in the united states tony fratto the deputy white house press secretary said white house reassurances  am in an address just minutes ago president bush put his finger on the cause of the global freefall a lack in confidence heres a few sentences from agence francepresse president george w bush on friday blamed uncertainty and fear for much of the global financial meltdown and insisted us authorities have the tools they need to confront the crisis worries are understandable but anxiety can feed anxiety and that can make it hard to see all that is being done to address the problem he said promising we can solve this crisis and we will this has been a deeply unsettling period for the american people he added the us government is acting and will continue to act  the dow continued to fall since the presidents statement but the white house confidencebuilding campaign was far

S'the technical term for it is negative feedback loop the rest of us just call it a panic how else to explain yet another plunge in the stock market tuesday that sent the standard  poors stock index to its lowest level in five years  particularly in the absence of another nasty surprise  if anything the markets should have been buoyed by the federal reserve saying it would shore up another troubled corner of finance by lending money directly to companies stocks did open higher but then quickly tumbled as rumors swirled about the viability of big financial firms like morgan stanley and the royal bank of scotland  anybody searching for causeandeffect logic in the daily gyrations of the market will be disappointed  even if the overarching problem of a crisis of confidence in the global economy is now becoming clear instead the market has become a case study in the psychology of crowds many experts say in normal times it runs on a healthy mix of fear and greed but fear now seems to rule with investors often exhibiting a wall street version of the fightorflight mechanism  they are selling first and asking questions later  whats happening is people are crawling into a bunker and pulling an iron sheet over their heads because they think the sky is falling said william ackman a prominent hedge fund manager in new york  and that bunker is getting very crowded so much so that some analysts are starting to suggest the markets are showing signs of capitulation  another term of art to describe what happens when even the bullish holdouts the unflagging optimists throw up their hands and join the stampede out of the market  fear can be seen at every turn  in headlines raising questions about another great depression and in the crowds gathered around office televisions to track stocks or to parse the latest pronouncements from the federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke or the treasury secretary henry m paulson jr  even james cramer the voluble and longbullish host of an investing show on cnbc advised investors to sell some stock during appearances on the today show monday and tuesday mornings to some signs of capitulation can be read as an indicator that the bottom may be near indeed sam stovall chief investment strategist at standard  poors equity research is among those who say the market may be close to a bottom  in addition to his analysis of the market he was swayed by the numerous telephone calls he has received in recent days from professional acquaintances and his sisterinlaw all saying they are getting out of stocks more and more people are doing that and selling out mr stovall said the opposite of capitulation of course is investing at the height of a bubble one oftcited sign of the housing markets top when dinner parties are dominated by stories about fast profits on flipped condominiums  during the dotcom boom in the late s it seemed everybody and their grandmothers were piling into stocks now they are bailing out tuesday was the fourth consecutive day that the s p stock index registered a decline of  percent or more the last time that happened was october  when the index reached its lowest point during the bear market that started in  the s p is now down  percent from its peak a year ago almost to the day on oct   another barometer of panic volatility reflected in the socalled fear index or the vix which tracks options trades that investors use to protect against future losses on tuesday it climbed to its highest level since the  stock market crash fear is an immensely powerful force perhaps more so than greed said andrew w lo a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology who has studied investor behavior  scientists who have studied the brain function have found that the amygdala the part of the brain that controls fear responds faster than the parts of the brain that handle cognitive functions he said  fear is a much stronger motivational force mr lo added the loss of  has a much bigger impact than the gain of a  he cites a series of groundbreaking experiments in the s by psychologists daniel kahneman and amos tversky in one test they asked students to choose between a sure bet of  or an  percent chance of winning  meaning there was a  percent chance of winning nothing most students said they would take the  the same question framed differently asked them if they would rather lose  or accept an  percent chance of losing  with a  percent chance of losing nothing in this case they said they would take the riskier bet  in other words they were willing to take a bigger risk to avoid losing money than they were when they stood to make more money those instincts seem to be taking over  at this point any spreadsheet analysis of underlying and intrinsic values of stocks becomes meaningless and concern for preserving wealth overrides the desire to grow it  what some may call greed with negative emotions we tend to have a desire to change the situation said ellen peters a senior scientist at decision research in eugene ore but when things are good there is not much desire to change that perhaps explains why investors are willing to earn virtually no return in treasury bills just to be assured that they will get their money back rather than investing in shortterm corporate debt that offers a better return but carries some risk investors were reminded of that risk after lehman brothers sought bankruptcy protection last month even banks which make money by lending to businesses consumers and each other are hoarding cash that is why the federal reserve said on tuesday that it would buy commercial paper the shortterm loans issued by companies and banks if the market is indeed close to the bottom history suggests any rally in the next few weeks will probably be big since world war ii mr stovall estimates stocks have recouped about a third of their bear market losses in the first  days after the market hits bottom but enough investors have to first be persuaded that the economy and housing market will begin recovering soon another major test will be thirdquarter corporate earnings announcements that will trickle out in the next three weeks  perhaps the most important indicator will be the credit markets investors will regain confidence when they believe financial firms are adequately capitalized and money is flowing more freely through the financial system mr ackman the hedge fund manager who has been vocal about his bearish views of some financial companies in recent years said it is hard to precisely time the market but he added i do think that stocks are getting extremely cheap david bertocchi a portfolio manager for baring asset management in london echoed that sentiment saying he was beginning to increase his stake in certain companies  he is taking advantage he said of panicked selling by hedge funds that have to pay back loans to their brokers thats what drives markets to attractive levels he said'

VCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- No sooner had construction begun in the late 1980s on the 42-story bank headquarters -- the tallest building in North Carolina -- than its biggest rival announced it would build a taller building right up the street. If one bank gave $50,000 to the Chamber of Commerce, the other wrote a check for the same amount. When one built a performing arts center, the other built a museum. For decades here, it has been thus: the two banks, homegrown Wachovia and the larger Bank of America, gleefully one-upping each other, and Charlotte coming out the winner.

the other built a museum for decades here it has been thus the two banks homegrown wachovia and the larger bank of america gleefully oneupping each other and charlotte coming out the winner                             with wachovia dominating the south end of tryon street uptowns main thoroughfare and bank of america dominating the north end charlotte became the secondlargest banking center in the nation behind new york                             but last week as wachovia which employs  people here became the latest financial institution to succumb to the credit crisis the long spirit of competition between the two banks swiftly turned to concern                             when you go to a boxing match you want to win in the ring said john gachora a managing director at bank of america not because all your opponents had a car crash on the way to the ring                             with the financial crisis vividly in evidence the mood on tryon street was palpably glum last weekend after long hours of work trying to save wachovia one middleaged employee had a fatal heart attack in raleigh executives at rbc bank canceled the parachuters that were supposed to appear at the grand opening of its new headquarters saying it was not an appropriate time to have people jumping off a bank building                             between the announcement on monday that wachovia would be forced to sell much of the company to citigroup for an amount equal to  a share and the news on friday of a more significant counteroffer from wells fargo it has been a rollercoaster ride for the city even those who knew wachovia was in trouble were shocked at the speed of its decline at happy hour the casual attire of those already laid off stood out against the dark suits of the stillemployed but nervous on wednesday night mortons one of a herd of steakhouses catering to the banking crowd was virtually empty                             like many wachovia shareholders tom dunn  who was a lawyer for wachovia for years and is now at a law firm was rethinking his retirement date after losing more than  million in wachovia stock  about half his savings im very disappointed mr dunn said wednesday im telling myself that anger probably is not healthful                             his disappointment was tempered a bit by the news about wells fargo  long regarded as a better geographical match for wachovia because it is based on the west coast and could benefit from wachovias large east coast footprint  stepping in with a  a share offer citigroup is contesting the deal and on saturday night it said that a judge in new york issued an emergency order temporarily blocking the merger with wells fargo many in charlotte have hopes that a sale to wells fargo would help preserve jobs                             even if the jobs stay said bob morgan president of the charlotte chamber of commerce from a civic perspective we can no longer walk across the street and see the ceo of the fourthlargest bank in the country                             the banks respective territory is so jealously guarded that when wachovia installed its first atm on the north end of tryon street it was frontpage news in the charlotte observer                             the two banks had different cultures wachovia which started in winstonsalem and was acquired by charlottes first union in  was regarded as a laidback collegial place where even in this crisis topranking executives have kept their jobs                             bank of america which has  employees here is widely viewed as a more aggressive culture flavored by the style of its longtime leader hugh l mccoll jr an exmarine my boss used to work at bank of america said a young wachovia investment banker who declined to give his name because of insecurity about his job she said shed go in every day putting on her armor                             but social life was a different story wachovia and bank of america executives live in the same neighborhoods their children go to the same schools and their junior associates frequent the same uptown bars                             on tuesday robert stickler a senior vice president at bank of america said a wachovia executive would be joining his family for rosh hashana dinner in business they were very fierce competitors but that ended when the business day ended mr stickler said theres a lot of concern inside our headquarters over the last couple of days because a lot of us have friends at wachovia they were working as hard as we were they just made a bad decision                             when the banks were smaller their contest was fiercer said george v hanna iii a lawyer at moore  van allen and a longtime charlotte resident if you were for one you were against the other mr hanna said it was very difficult for providers of professional services like law firms to work for both of them as the banks got larger the competition within charlotte lessened                             both viewed charlotte as an important investment led by the banks the city poured money into sports facilities and graceful streetscaping making charlotte  the largest city in north carolina  a magnet for young collegeeducated professionals and keeping its real estate market strong even as the rest of the country suffered                             when the forced sale of wachovia was announced monday mr mccoll who is no longer with bank of america called it a body blow to the city                             everywhere the conversation centered on the details of the sale would the buyer retain wachovias name with its reputation for sterling customer service or jettison it as tainted by financial failure would the retail banking division stay in charlotte                             what would happen to the new wachovia tower with its stateoftheart trading floors under construction on south tryon street and the arts complex that was part of the project the cranes are still working said micheal shook who works at an agency that provides staff for the two banks                             the uncertainty was not limited to the south end of tryon bank of america is also in flux after its purchase of merrill lynch last month prompting worries that much of the companys investment banking would move to new york a significant drain of financial jobs from the city would affect real estate values recruitment support companies like law and accounting firms and other issues that have a bearing on both banks                             one executive at bank of america said the mood was evident when he announced that he would be leaving for another job                             if i went last year to resign my

VON WARM EVENINGS, ESPECIALLY when the light lasts long, 11-year-old Lucy Friedman-Bell rides her Razor scooter up West Rock Avenue until she gets to the corner of West Elm Street. If she crossed West Elm and kept going, she would soon arrive at our house, where she would see me and my wife sitting on our front porch with our 1-year-old daughter, Rebekah, and her best friend, J. J. the spotted mutt, snuggled between us. But Lucy's not allowed to leave her block by herself, so she turns around and goes back toward her house, the fifth in from Yale Avenue at the other end. Before she gets there, she will pass about a dozen houses -- some on her side of the street, some across the street -- whose inhabitants know her. ''Hi, Lucy!'' they call, and she always waves, sometimes with the regal, cupped-hand wave of the queen, and shouts in her small voice, ''Hi!'' Lucy's head is barely visible under her helmet, and people appreciate the effort it must take to call back to them. She used to make this circuit on her bicycle, but last year it was stolen. The whole street went into mourning, and we whispered to one another, ''What will Lucy do without her bike?'' But after a week of shiva, she emerged on the scooter, and all seemed well again. She does this circuit, up and down the block, every day she can, sometimes for an hour or two. ''It's my thinking time,'' she told me. I know a lot of the people on my street, by which I mean the two blocks of West Rock Avenue between Yale and Edgewood Avenues in New Haven, where my life seems mainly to take place. I know all six members of Lucy's family, whose nickname is the Friebellarkenthals. They are the Brady Bunch of West Rock Avenue, created when Richard Bell, who lost his wife, Trudy Friedman, to cancer five months after she gave birth to his twins, Hannah and Lucy, fell in love with Marjorie Rosenthal, whose husband, Amal Murarka, was killed in a car crash when their children, Elina and Maya, were 7 weeks and 2. The Friedman-Bell twins are fair, though otherwise they don't look alike; the Murarka girls look half Indian, a reminder of their father.

and kept going she would soon arrive at our house where she would see me and my wife sitting on our front porch with our yearold daughter rebekah and her best friend j j the spotted mutt snuggled between us but lucys not allowed to leave her block by herself so she turns around and goes back toward her house the fifth in from yale avenue at the other end before she gets there she will pass about a dozen houses  some on her side of the street some across the street  whose inhabitants know her hi lucy they call and she always waves sometimes with the regal cuppedhand wave of the queen and shouts in her small voice hi lucys head is barely visible under her helmet and people appreciate the effort it must take to call back to them she used to make this circuit on her bicycle but last year it was stolen the whole street went into mourning and we whispered to one another what will lucy do without her bike but after a week of shiva she emerged on the scooter and all seemed well again she does this circuit up and down the block every day she can sometimes for an hour or two its my thinking time she told me the faulkners dismantled half of their garage to make a party space  i know a lot of the people on my street by which i mean the two blocks of west rock avenue between yale and edgewood avenues in new haven where my life seems mainly to take place i know all six members of lucys family whose nickname is the friebellarkenthals they are the brady bunch of west rock avenue created when richard bell who lost his wife trudy friedman to cancer five months after she gave birth to his twins hannah and lucy fell in love with marjorie rosenthal whose husband amal murarka was killed in a car crash when their children elina and maya were  weeks and  the friedmanbell twins are

from them live a family i havent met yet but who i hear homeschool their children when rebekah j j and i try to visit the chaudhrysamuels we often fail to arrive waylaid by friends we pass on the way sometimes tom bontly a philosopher at the university of connecticut or his wife allison ponce a psychologist is the culprit more often its matt higbee a journalist turned software entrepreneur or his wife nicole fluhr an english professor at nearby southern connecticut state university or one of their two young daughters tessa and miranda thats not everybody not even close i also know linda drazen and her wife meg bloom  they married in massachusetts in august more than  years ago meg was an early member of the cooperative day care center that still exists in the basement of the synagogue i now

naomi the flutist and pattie belle the graphic designer and jim the concert promoter whom i keep meaning to ask for free steely dan tickets what surprises me is that i like knowing these people im a new englander which means i dont smile broadly at strangers and ask how theyre doing i might borrow a cup of sugar but if so im sure to repay the debt the next day i inherited from my father who spent part of his childhood in the south a deep antipathy toward the false chumminess that so often passes for neighborliness like many americans between leaving home and marriage i lived in apartments and everything about them suited me above all the understood transience that required of neighbors little more than polite nods when we passed in the hallways neighbors responsibilities to one another included keeping the music down and curbing the dog ive changed my mind for many reasons including the obvious i became a father someone who understands that the people on my block are my little daughters entire world these other toddlers are the ones who will invite her for sleepovers in six or seven years in their houses she will eat junk food and watch cable tv and then not tell us about it their parents will keep her safe so id better like these people around me or at least get to trust them mark oppenheimer is an editor of the new haven review and a frequent contributor to the new

VSeveral weeks ago, before the earth cracked open on Wall Street, Imam Khalid Latif had a chat with one of his regular worshipers at the Muslim center at New York University. This young man, a business student, had a theological complaint to register. Why did Islam make such a big deal about the principle of mutual benefit? What was the matter with just taking care of yourself? About 10 days later, with the landscape marked by the bankruptcy, emergency sale and federal bailout of some of the nation's most venerable financial companies, a more abashed version of that same student returned. ''Now I know why I can't define security by the number of zeroes on my paycheck,'' Imam Latif, N.Y.U.'s Muslim chaplain, recalled the man saying.

S'several weeks ago before the earth cracked open on wall street imam khalid latif had a chat with one of his regular worshipers at the muslim center at new york university this young man a business student had a theological complaint to register why did islam make such a big deal about the principle of mutual benefit what was the matter with just taking care of yourself about  days later with the landscape marked by the bankruptcy emergency sale and federal bailout of some of the nations most venerable financial companies a more abashed version of that same student returned now i know why i cant define security by the number of zeroes on my paycheck imam latif nyus muslim chaplain recalled the man saying presented with the spiritual equivalent of what educators call a teachable moment imam latif spoke to the student about the humility perseverance and especially the islamic concept of sabr meaning patience he offered a hadith from the muslim tradition patience comes at the first sign of calamity variations of the imams conversation have been proceeding in virtually every faith these last few weeks especially for clergy members who have a following among the investors executives and employees of the shaken financial industry they are practicing ministry for a meltdown there is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole goes the wartime clich as if to make the truism even truer the recent financial troubles have coincided with two religious periods devoted to soulsearching  the muslim holy month of ramadan and the jewish days of awe culminating in rosh hashana and yom kippur the high holy days are a time people take stock of their life said rabbi joshua metzger of the chabad lubavitch center in midtown manhattan and the confluence of the financial crisis and this period of penitence is surely in sync with the message of selfappraisal repentance reexamination and the need to make good decisions as the united states staggers from its credit binge to a straitened future the religious holidays demand their own form of selfdenial jews fast on yom kippur and for the most observant the fast of gedalia which comes the day after rosh hashana devout muslims did not take food or drink during daylight hours for the entire month of ramadan which ended this week the purpose of the fast goes beyond a physical one imam latif said it puts into perspective a lot when you have that drink of water at sundown when you eat that date to break the fast you have a deeper appreciation of what you have the rev george w rutler pastor of the roman catholic church of our saviour in midtown manhattan has been giving a similar message to the younger of his parishioners unlike the older generation which lived through  the great depression these men and women had known nothing except exuberant days for investment banks hedge funds and the stock market theyre just astonished they have no historical reference said father rutler the former national chaplain of legatus a group of prominent catholic executives ive said to them youre part of history now and in the future you will learn to be more practical about value this was a necessary purge painful in many ways the weekday mass on sept  supplied father rutler with texts to underscore his lessons in prudence and frugality one of the readings proverbs  included the admonition to give me neither poverty nor riches provide me only with the food i need the gospel reading from luke  had jesus dispatching his disciples to travel among the people to heal the sick and tame demons take nothing for the journey he instructs them neither walking stick nor sack nor food nor money the rev suzan  johnson cook has turned more often to biblical passages of solace she has made a clerical specialty of ministering to the black and latino middle and uppermiddle classes both as pastor of the bronx christian fellowship and as leader for a worship service every wednesday at noon at the john street united methodist church amid the canyons of lower manhattan for her flock relatively new arrivals to lucrative jobs in finance the economic tremors have threatened to undo generations of struggling progress the stress level is just high ms cook said its a feeling of not knowing what your last day will be these are people with a family to support with kids in college they feel like it took so long to make it we played by the rules and now look what happened how am i going to make it at a pragmatic level ms cook has referred congregants to career counselors particularly those who charge on a sliding scale in both sermons and pastoral sessions she has turned to psalms  and  verses that ask for mercy and compassion from a god who hast  been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy at chabad in midtown rabbi metzger has also emphasized the need for trust in the almighty  he has frequently quoted from a talk that the late lubavitcher rebbe menachem mendel schneerson gave shortly after the stock market crash in october  the rebbe gave a blessing that it should be revealed that there is only descent for the purpose of ascent and just in case any listener might misconstrue rabbi metzger adds this is not a matter of financial advice this isnt jim cramer email sgfreedmannytimescom'

S'                    s paulo brazil  as americas financial crisis was gathering speed brazils president seemed dismissive almost gleeful about the troubles up north                             what crisis said the president luiz ino lula da silva when asked last month about the financial maelstrom go ask bush about that                             like a number of south american countries brazil had been flashing a newfound confidence one born of a deliberate push to decrease political and economic reliance on the united states but on monday shortly after congress rejected a proposed  billion bailout package mr da silva struck a very different tone saying in his weekly radio address that brazil was not immune from the spreading woes after all                             a recessionary crisis in a country like the united states he explained to brazilians can bring problems to all countries                             in only a few days latin american leaders have gone from schadenfreude to fear despite strong economic growth this decade and some aggressive efforts to break free of the american orbit there is a growing nervousness that once again latin america cannot escape the globalized connections in the financial sector that run through the united states                             after seeming to revel in the collapse of lehman brothers hugo chz venezuelas president skipped the opening of the united nationsgeneral assembly last week to visit china instead saying that beijing was now much more relevant than new york                             but by tuesday after the american stock market plunged nearly  points dragging down latin american exchanges with it new york and wall street in particular had suddenly become relevant once more with mr chz saying at a summit meeting in brazil that the financial crisis would have the force of one hundred hurricanes                             a number of governments in the region have been working for the past decade to reduce their dependence on the american economy they have diversified trade with the rest of the world while also making efforts to save tens and sometimes hundreds of billions of dollars for times when international conditions turn sour                             as their economies strengthened and their political cooperation took off it seemed the united states was being rapidly pushed out of the picture latin american leaders were standing up to america with growing bravado                             in the past month both venezuela and bolivia expelled the american ambassadors to their countries not only did brazil thought to be among americas strongest allies in the region support the expulsion by bolivia a major source of natural gas but mr da silva also railed against an american naval presence in the region warning that his nation needed to put its own warships on alert in response                             such antiamerican sentiment reflects a longstanding bitterness over washingtons economic prescriptions for latin america policies that some countries in the region blame for undercutting them as wall street itself started to unravel some leaders seemed to feel vindicated by the collapse                             we are witnessing the first world which at one point had been painted as a mecca we should strive to reach popping like a bubble cristina fernez de kirchner argentinas president said two weeks ago                             but the financial crisis has exploded far beyond wall street whipsawing global markets are already having a ripple effect across latin america as nervous investors pulled money out of emerging markets brazils currency the real plunged  percent against the dollar last month resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at large food and eucalyptuspulp exporters that placed bad bets on the direction of the real                             in mexico falling remittances from the united states are also raising concern with finance minister augustcarstens warning that money sent home from across the border could decline by  billion or  percent this year in venezuela a sharp drop in the value of the countrys bonds in the last two weeks reflects fears about plunging oil prices especially since the united states remains by far the largest buyer of venezuelan oil despite the deterioration of relations between the countries                             the issue economists say is largely about access to credit which is needed to keep latin americas exportoriented economies humming along the credit crunch and the liquidity constraints we are seeing are going to affect everyone in the world said alfredo coutia senior economist at moodys the creditrating agency that means that the cost for latin american companies particularly for those with the need for external funds is going to be higher                             plummeting commodity prices could also hamper growth in countries like argentina and ecuador while the psychological effect of a crash in the united states is already reverberating through latin american stock exchanges that could lead to a reining in of household spending which has driven much of the recent growth in brazils economy especially economists said                             some governments are also directly tied to the american institutions they have derided as in venezuela where the government has lost about  million in lehmanrelated investments        '

The contract, which was signed with Atlantic Express Bus, will bring in about $500,000 a year in rent to the city for 85,000 square feet of space. Previously, the space had been used as an impound lot."We have never gotten so much for land," said Lee Winter, director of leasing at New York City's Economic Development Corporation, which runs an asset management service for the city's properties, including Staten Island Stadium and Essex Street Market. About 100 buses will fit in the space.

they offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other but neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond just  hours earlier few imagined monday would play out this way treasury secretary henry m paulson jr and the house speaker nancy pelosi announced sunday afternoon they had agreed

VAs the financial crisis grew, even Jim Cramer found it hard to explain. Mr. Cramer, the hyperactive host of ''Mad Money'' on CNBC, knows how to appeal to his usual audience of day traders and market buffs. But over the last two weeks, as the very definition of Wall Street has been rewritten, Mr. Cramer found himself having to explain arcane financial concepts like credit-default swaps to an audience that was double its usual size and spooked by the market's moves.

S'as the financial crisis grew even jim cramer found it hard to explain mr cramer the host of mad money on cnbc  passersby peered into the nasdaq studio in times square on friday as bailout talks continued  mr cramer the hyperactive host of mad money on cnbc knows how to appeal to his usual audience of day traders and market buffs but over the last two weeks as the very definition of wall street has been rewritten mr cramer found himself having to explain arcane financial concepts like creditdefault swaps to an audience that was double its usual size and spooked by the markets moves  we have to find a way to cover this in english on monday mr cramer wrote in a long email message to cliff mason a nephew and a writer for the show on sept  since sept  when the investment bank lehman brothers said it intended to file for bankruptcy protection and bank of america said it would acquire merrill lynch the threat to peoples pocketbooks has supplanted politics as the countrys dominant reality tv show on every channel journalists were struggling with questions that were flummoxing the viewers and as it turned out the best minds on wall street and in washington how did we get here what happens next and what does it all mean mr cramers solution was telling his nephew to get a clip from clint eastwoods  western film unforgiven and suggested showing the scene when the sheriff with a gun to his head says i dont deserve this in the film the killer replied deserves got nothing to do with it and then shoots the man  deserves has everything to do with it mr cramer exclaimed in the email message asserting that the bankers who made bad bets should be punished we have to work that in for the moment at least seemingly the entire country cares about the markets  the week of sept  was the highestrated one in cnbcs year history with  viewers during the business day counted as the  am to  pm hours by cnbc last week the ratings remained high with an average   viewers through thursday  mark hoffman the president of cnbc said the network had focused for years on the delicate balance in business between fear and greed  when theres an aggressive move to one extreme or the other cnbc engagement surges he said through much of this crisis fear has beat greed silly as tom brakke an investment firm consultant put it in a blog post last week the viewer impulse was perhaps the same basic instinct that attracts onlookers to a car crash  the ratings have also soared for the fox news channel cnn and msnbc in recent weeks presumably they have also increased for the business channels fox business network and bloomberg but their ratings are not publicly reported by nielsen business pundits are suddenly in demand cnbc reporters have contributed daily to the nbc nightly news and fox business network hosts have appeared on  and the view  at one point during its coverage the cnbc screen was filled with the faces of eight reporters and commentators including one who was caught in the midst of a phone call  a demonstration of overkill that jon stewart of the daily show called the octobox when seven people talking about something just isnt enough jonathan wald the senior vice president for business news at cnbc said the networks priority remains getting information to viewers in real time  if you see anchors on the set with phones to their ears and computers at the ready you know it means they are reporting right up until the time the red light goes on he said while collateralized debt obligations are hardly tvfriendly material the gradually unfolding pace of the crisis was tailormade for the medium the internet is increasingly the medium of choice for stock quotes and market commentary yet tv still provides a drip of news  when paul debettignies a yearold information technology recruiter in minneapolis saw that cnbc was showing live programming the last two sunday nights  at times normally reserved for documentary reruns  he knew something had to be wrong  since then he has watched every day because he figures whatevers going on in new york and washington will get here eventually but his questions are numerous how does this tie in with the overall economy how will this affect our banks  for mr cramer the collapse of the nations leading investment banks harked back to an onair outburst in august  when he said that the federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke has no idea how bad it is out there thirteen months later mr cramer is still speaking at a fever pitch on monday adorned with a purple tie and a rarely seen grimace mr cramer fretted about the government bailout if this doesnt work he warned were going to have great depression ii he repeated the warning four  times during the hour as the bailout talks dominated washington last week the financial story became more political and the testimony of the treasury secretary henry m paulson jr was carried live by the cable networks the election was never far from the coverage as the segments titled your money your vote showed on cnn its as if americans are studying for a test and our coverage is a big part of their notes and research said liz claman a fox business anchor'

VIMAGINE, if you will, that a man who had much to do with creating the present credit crisis now says he is the man to fix this giant problem, and that his work is so important that he will need a trillion dollars or so of your money. Then add that this man thinks he is so indispensable that he wants Congress to forbid any judicial or administrative questioning of anything he does with your dollars. You might think of a latter-day Lenin or Fidel Castro, but you would be far afield. Instead, you should be thinking of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the rapidly disintegrating United States of America, right here and now.

S' imagine if you will that a man who had much to do with creating the present credit crisis now says he is the man to fix this giant problem and that his work is so important that he will need a trillion dollars or so of your money then add that this man thinks he is so indispensable that he wants congress to forbid any judicial or administrative questioning of anything he does with your dollars   you might think of a latterday lenin or fidel castro but you would be far afield instead you should be thinking of treasury secretary henry m paulson jr and the rapidly disintegrating united states of america right here and now   but i am getting ahead of myself first i am furious at what the traders speculators hedge funds and the government have done to everyone who is saving and investing for retirement and future security millions of us did nothing wrong according to the accepted wisdom of the age we saved we put a large part of our money into the stock market as we were urged to do because the market wasnt at ridiculously high levels it seemed prudent to invest in broad indexes foreign indexes and small and largecap indexes  now we have had the rug pulled out from under us our retirements have been put into severe jeopardy the earnings part of those pricetoearnings ratios turns out to have been fiction for some financial companies which normally account for a big part of total corporate earnings in fact earnings of giant finance players were often wildly negative creating a situation rarely seen since the great depression when the aggregate earnings of the dow  were negative  the current negativity occurred because of wild casinotype operations of big finance players creating liabilities way beyond anything we could have reasonably expected this looks a lot like theft on a spectacular scale  of our wallets our peace of mind our futures  second according to what i hear from my betters in the world of finance the most serious problems are not with the bundles of subprime mortgages themselves  a large but not lethal quantum as far as i can tell  but with derivatives contracts tied to subprime and other dicey debt these contracts are superficially an attempt to insure against risks of default hence the name creditdefault swaps in fact they are an immense wager  which anyone with lots of money or borrowing ability can enter  about how mortgagebacked bonds leveraged loan bonds student loan bonds credit card bonds and the like will perform  these wagers entail amounts many times larger than the total of subprime loans in fact there are roughly  trillion in creditdefault swap derivatives out there compared with about  trillion of subprime mortgages these derivatives are weapons of financial mass destruction in the prophetic words of warren e buffett apparently believing that the worst is over at least for one big investment bank mr buffett is now investing in goldman sachs the swaps market has been unregulated it has been just a lot of people making bets with one another some of them made incredibly fortunate payoff wagers against the mortgage bonds using creditdefault swaps as their wagering vehicle i am not sure who the big winners are but they are out there and the gains were big enough to cripple the part of wall street on the losing side of the bets  almost no one except mr buffett saw this coming at least not on this scale but lets get back to the man of the hour why didnt mr paulson the treasury secretary see it he was once the head of goldman sachs an immense player in the swaps world didnt people at treasury have a clue if they didnt what was going on in their heads if they did why didnt they do something about it a year ago when saving the world would have been a lot cheaper  if mr paulson and ben s bernanke the chairman of the federal reserve didnt see this train coming what else have they missed what other freight train is barreling down the track at us  all of this would be bad enough but by far the most terrifying item i read in my morning paper last week was this mr paulson demanded that congress forbid judicial review of his decisions on use of the money in the mortgage bailout this would amount to an abrogation of the constitution not only would his decisions be sacrosanct and above the law but so would the actions of his pals in the banking world in connection with this bailout  the people whose conduct got us into this catastrophe have not only taken our money hopes and peace of mind but they apparently also want a trillion or so more dollars to put into their wall street buddy system fund this may be the most dangerous attack on the law in my lifetime what anarchists even dared consider this plan thank heaven that minds more devoted to the constitution on capitol hill are questioning this shocking request  by the way if we are actually thinking about tossing the constitution out the window why not simply annul these creditdefault swap contracts with that done the incomprehensibly large liability of the banks would cease and we wouldnt need this staggering bailout shouldnt we consider making the speculators pay some of the price  we have survived housingprice corrections before why is this one causing so much anguish it must be the side bets the creditdefault swap bets multiplying the effect of the housing downturn many times over maybe we should just get rid of these exotic bets and start again without them insurance on market moves is always a bad idea because it does not tamp down market disruptions but instead greatly magnifies them  as in the disastrous effect of portfolio insurance in the  crash then there was mr paulsons insistence that there be no compensation caps for executives of companies being bailed out by the factory workers the farmers the schoolteachers and the medical doctors he told a skeptical congress on tuesday that if these caps were put into place bank executives simply wouldnt participate in the bailout or sell us suckers their debts fine with me if the banks are in good enough shape so that petulant executives can simply opt out rather than live on a few million a year maybe we dont need the bailout at all maybe we would be better off if those executives simply bailed out and were replaced by people with more sense and more patriotism  one final little thought bubbles into my mind maybe the bailout should not be of the banks at all but of homeowners themselves maybe if we make the government the buyer of last resort of homes we will stabilize the markets stabilize the debt associated with the markets and take the gain out of the creditdefault swaps for the speculators yes price would be a huge issue but so it is for mr paulsons plan for buying debt from banks  why not we do it for farmers why not for the individual homeowner oh right because treasury secretaries dont know any of those people   ben stein is a lawyer writer actor and economist email ebiznytimescom'

VEitherBarack Obama or John McCain could well become the first U.S. president since John F. Kennedy to be elected during a recession, not to mention a financial crisis. What sort of nation will the winner inherit? Although the string of bank failures and panic on Wall Street has overtones of the 1930s, the risk is less a repeat of the Great Depression than that of another Japan, which, following a stock-market and real-estate mania that peaked in 1989, suffered through a so-called ''lost decade'' -- 10 years of economic stagnation and a seemingly unending cycle of falling asset values and government bailouts. With that grim example very much in mind, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, a lifelong student of economic calamities, and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are trying to walk a very fine line -- injecting hundreds of billions into the financial system while not propping up so much deadwood that the system can never recover. President Obama/McCain will face a similar tension -- how many failing mortgage holders to resuscitate, how much and what sort of fiscal stimulus?

holders to resuscitate how much and what sort of fiscal stimulus  but they also will have to deal with a knottier set of issues what can washington do to break the pathologic cycle of speculative boom followed by titanic bust it is true that booms and busts are inevitable features of markets to paraphrase a wall street truism were it not for speculators perhaps neither the railroads nor google would have been financed  but when markets require bailouts of the two largest mortgage companies an investment bank and a giant insurer in the space of six months  with a general mortgage bailout in the works  it is a sign that the system has stopped working more explicitly the system encouraged and permitted a degree of risk that has proved intolerable  it is well to remember that aig once sported the tag line the biggest risk is not taking one to investors raised on maxims of prudence the slogan served as a dare it meant that if your assets were safe then you probably were not earning enough of a return and maybe did not deserve to invest at all  the utter recklessness of this philosophy did not become fully manifest until the insurer was rescued with an  billion line of credit from the fed in the wake of that bailout investors had so little appetite for risk that even the stocks of sound institutions were beaten to a pulp so desperate were investors to unload risk that treasury bills the ultimate safe investment were offering a null return people were lending to the us treasury on the promise of zero interest  merely knowing their capital was safe was profit enough  as highly leveraged investment banks derivatives traders and unregulated hedge funds were pummeled regulated institutions like banks were relatively stable a ruinous law seemed to be operating on wall street wherever the system was most fragile and wherever the regulatory walls were least effective the panic was greatest perhaps that wasnt an accident a few years ago in a paper titled regulation and reaction david moss and sarah brennan of the harvard business school and columbia university respectively recounted the telling experience of new york state banks in the midth century banks in that era issued notes that served as currency but when confidence ebbed and too many people tried to exchange their notes for gold panic ensued and banks failed so in the s new york instituted a primitive safeguard it required banks to back their notes with highgrade government bonds this reduced risk to the system but it limited the banks ability to lend the law said nothing however about checking accounts in due course banks greatly expanded their use of such accounts which soon became the dominant form of bank money in new york alas in  a crash in railroad bonds spurred a panic harpers reported that wall street was choked by thousands of people endeavoring to force their way to the banking houses to demand specie  gold that is  for their checks  the lesson moss told me is that contagion is like a flood it finds its way into the part you dont protect in  and its aftermath that meant stocks purchased on credit and bank deposits the protections added in the s were remarkable and their effect endures today though banks are under pressure their depositors sleep soundly people lose jobs but they receive unemployment and continue to spend  but those protections are hardly enough financial innovation ever seeks the freest terrain the last generation has witnessed a hothouse of new financial products  really a new more supple notion of finance and one that is incredibly complex but the basic securities architecture from the new deal remains unchanged and has even been loosened  a generation ago if you bought an insurance policy against a default the insurer who sold it was required to maintain adequate capital today you can enter into a creditdefault swap aig wrote billions of dollars worth even if your capital is insufficient every derivative thanks to wall streets successful lobbying was declared to be not a security and thus largely outside the sight of the securities and exchange commission our umpires have been watching the wrong field  this is not to say that washington is the main culprit markets were incredibly foolish the dubious mortgages that were written the credit ratings that blessed them and the trust that banks put in them were speculative and stupid but we know that people do foolish things markets almost demand it if you are lehman brothers and you do not borrow you do not earn as much as your peers then your stock falls and you get taken over so you borrow only regulation can check this instinct investment banks should be subject to limits on leverage hedge funds need scrutiny and more alan blinder the

S'                    to the editor                             re administration is seeking  billion for wall st bailout could set record front page sept                              the bailout plan for american financial institutions appears to put most or all of the risk on taxpayers and minimal risk on the institutions that made incredibly large numbers of incredibly poor financial decisions if this plan is put into effect we will witness the final and most devastating act of the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the truly rich in this nations history                             i miss the good old days when hard work was rewarded and incompetence was punished these days we have it backward                             mitchell turkerportland ore sept                               to the editor                             so an administration that is unsuccessful at war disaster relief and so on now wants to be given a free hand in spending  billion on assets for

         i cannot help but think that this is more a bailout for its friends in the financial industry than something needed to help ordinary americans                             i would feel more comfortable that this was not some gift to financial institutions if those institutions that took part in the bailout had to revoke top managements stock incentives given during the last five years were forbidden to award such incentives over the next five years had to cap salaries at  and had to pay into a fund that would help repay at least a portion of these costs                             otherwise i can see the day when these firms again operate based on greed and their managers profit while taxpayers foot the bill for their ineptitude                             roy weberridgewood nj

                   to the editor                             once again democrats are falling into the trap of allowing the bush administration to frame the response to a crisis just as in  democrats will allow president bush and his supporters to frame the qualifications and responses of patriotic legislators                             the present crisis did not happen overnight and no one should expect congress to enact anything close to resembling a comprehensive and effective response in a matter of a few days                             douglas salernotraverse city mich sept                               to the editor                             american families are hurting in many ways these days the mortgage crisis threatens tens of thousands of families with the loss of their homes the wall street meltdown undoubtedly means layoffs and bare pantries for many more families the gas crisis already has some parents facing painful choices about whether to heat their homes this winter or feed their children                             and let us not forget that hundreds of thousands of families in texas and louisiana are already without power or have actually lost their homes with schools serving  children closed because of hurricane ike parents in these devastated areas have no way to care for their children except to miss work  if indeed they still have jobs to go to                             american politicians need to stop focusing so much on the needs of investors and the gotcha politics of the campaign and tell us what they will do to help americas

paul krugman wrote about the current economic bailout before congress dont let yourself be railroaded  if this plan goes through in anything like its current form well all be very sorry in the nottoodistant future                             i am already sorry on sunday i read the business section of the times and was appalled by the chief executives salaries at our financial institutions even when they were cut in half those ceos of failed institutions should consider returning those millions to shareholders employees and taxpayers                             in all other segments of our democratic and capitalistic society employees are rewarded with higher salaries for work well done but in the business world success or failure the ceos walk away with obscene payments and now we are to bail them out                             middleclass citizens like me did not benefit from the bubble years and i dont see why we must pay back that debt incurred by recklessness and greed but something must be done and done quickly by congress                             i agree with mr krugman that some regulations should be tied to this bailout and that henry m paulson jr the treasury secretary should not be given dictatorial authority plus immunity from reviews                             mary leonardkingston ny sept                               to the editor

S'its the end of an era for merrill lynch the brokerage firm that brought wall street to main street merrill which has lost more than  billion on its mortgage investments agreed to sell itself to bank of america for  billion in stock it is a remarkable fall from grace for the yearold merrill whose corporate logo  a bull  has long symbolized the fundamental optimism of wall street notes the new york timess louise story after a frantic weekend of talks between wall street executives and federal officials over the fate of the teetering lehman brothers fear spread on sunday that merrill staggered by losses might also falter the merger would combine bank of americas banking and lending strength with merrill lynchs wealth management expertise it is an enormous shock steve fraser a wall street historian and author of wall street americas dream palace told the times merrill was a kind of bedrock institution whose stability and longevity was taken for granted and was reassuring to people mr fraser said even in these very highly erratic and speculative marketplaces like weve been living through you didnt think merrill would be vulnerable the sale if completed would open a new chapter for merrill which was founded in  and promoted the idea that anyone not just the rich should invest in markets merrills brokers would be combined with bank of americas smaller group of wealth advisers into an entity called merrill lynch wealth management the times said customers with brokerage accounts at merrill are unlikely to be financially affected merrill the nations largest brokerage firm was one of the earliest wall street firms to go public in  its executives traditionally former stockbrokers have long been viewed as spokespeople for the entire industry after the crash of  for instance merrills chief executive appeared on a television commercial and used one of the companys longtime slogans saying merrill lynch is still bullish on america last december john a thain merrills chairman and chief executive was brought in to try to salvage the troubled company it remains unclear how many merrill employees will be hired by bank of america since the credit crisis first flared more than a year ago merrill has been among the most wounded under its previous chief executive e stanley oneal merrill moved aggressively into the mortgage market and became one of the top issuers of investment vehicles linked to subprime mortgages and other risky forms of debt mr oneal was forced out last fall after the tumult in the mortgage market began since then the investment bank has taken

VDeputy Mayors Edward Skyler, Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey oppose a third term for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, while business leaders in the city generally support the idea. The debate exposes a crack in the administration's reputation for squabble-free, unified command. The deputy mayors have told associates that any campaign to change term limits, which restrict citywide elected offices to two consecutive four-year terms, could be viewed as an undemocratic end run around voters, who approved the current laws twice, in 1993 and 1996.

VIN this volatile market, investors have been understandably preoccupied with the day-to-day swings in stock prices. But instead of fixating on ticker movements, you might better spend your time paying attention to how this slide is affecting your long-term asset allocation strategy. Asset allocation -- or how much you invest in stocks versus bonds -- is probably the biggest determinant of the risk and returns you can expect from your portfolio. But in just 10 months, a declining stock market may have already undone some of your plans.

S'in this volatile market investors have been understandably preoccupied with the daytoday swings in stock prices but instead of fixating on ticker movements you might better spend your  time  paying attention to how this slide is affecting your longterm asset allocation strategy asset allocation  or how much you invest in stocks versus bonds  is probably the biggest determinant of the risk and returns you can expect from your portfolio but in just  months a declining stock market may have already undone some of your plans  how so if you started with a portfolio that was  percent stocks and  percent bonds at the market peak last october chances are that its now closer to a  mix  as stocks have sunk and bonds have risen depending on your age this mix may be far too conservative to meet your longterm needs  that is unless you rebalance but be careful although rebalancing seems a  simple concept  periodically booking some profits in assets that are up  in order to replenish your stake in those that are down   its far more complicated in practice if you  rebalanced right now for example you might sell some shares of a bond fund while picking up a few more shares of a broad market stock portfolio like the vanguard  index fund which tracks the standard  poors stock index well thanks to several years of marketbeating gains energy stocks now make up  percent of the s p  up from  percent in  this means that by rebalancing back into equity funds youll probably be adding to an already disproportionate weighting in a frothy sector  such issues are rarely considered financial planners say because few investors rebalance regularly when times are good investors neglect doing so because it means having to sell stocks that are soaring  and who likes to sell a winner and when times are bad rebalancing means having the courage to buy stocks as prices are tumbling which few investors are willing to do but with the market off about  percent  from its recent peak despite fridays rally now is a great time to think about rebalancing following  are a few suggestions rebalance your stocks too rebalancing isnt just about your stocks versus your bonds said james a shambo a financial planner in colorado springs its also about your small stocks versus your midcap stocks versus your largecap stocks and for that matter its also about your domestic stocks versus your international ones  say you put  percent of your equity portfolio into volatile emergingmarket shares at the start of  if you failed to rebalance for the next three years you would have entered  with more than  percent of your money in places like china and india   just in time to see those markets tank  since the start of this year the indian stock market has fallen  percent in dollar terms while the chinese market is  off more than  percent also in dollars   set the triggers many investors adjust their holdings once a year on a specific date like june  or dec  but if you wait until an arbitrary date to rebalance sizable gains or losses in your portfolio may have already selfcorrected  consider the october  market crash when the dow jones industrial average lost more than  percent in a single day if you waited until the midway point of the next year to adjust your portfolio you would have waited too long the dow recovered all but about  points of its losses by june   a better strategy is to rebalance whenever your underlying allocations shift by a certain amount   say  percent if you think your appropriate exposure to stocks is  percent but your stock weighting falls to say  percent consider rebalancing use common sense be realistic when it comes to rebalancing said ronald w rog a financial planner in bohemia ny if you have a small portfolio and rebalancing means selling or buying slivers in positions of  or less then it might not make sense to rebalance too frequently mr rog said  why not  because the transaction fees might erode such a sizable percentage of your portfolio it would defeat the purpose of rebalancing he said  if you owned  in smallcap stocks and that position shifted  percent you might incur  in commissions and taxes to sell just  worth of shares  dont drown in company stock over the last five years the weighting of the typical k investor  in his employers stock has fallen to around  percent from  percent does this mean its time to rebalance into more shares of your own company absolutely not said mike  scarborough president of scarborough capital  management a k investment advisory firm in annapolis md even though the allocation has been dropping  percent is still too big a stake to own in a single company  especially when its your own employer  if theyre rebalancing toward more company stock that would bring me to tears he said if anything i would hope they would rebalance away from it even more  if you dont agree mr scarborough says you need only ask employees at companies like bear stearns or enron  who tied the bulk of their retirement security to company shares    paul j lim is a senior editor at money magazine email fundnytimescom'

VRichard X Bove is seen as one of most outspoken stock analysts tracking banks, with 26-year career of going against conventional wisdom; following collapse of big California bank, his recent bearish report lists 107 banks ranked on two measures of financial strength that he believes are in trouble; share prices of some of banks in report collapse, and number 10 on first list, BankAtlantic Bancorp of Fort Lauderdale, sues him and his broker for defamation, claiming Bove's numbers are wrong; Bove often berates bank executives; fans of Bove are stunned by uproar over his list (M)

VThe word began spreading across Wall Street trading desks on Monday morning: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant companies at the heart of the nation's housing market, might be in trouble. The tumult, which continued on Thursday, started with a cautionary analyst's report, one that might have caused few ripples in normal times. But these are not normal times. Within minutes, the price of the companies' shares was plunging, sending shock waves through the financial markets, the economy and Washington.

S'when primetime cable news ratings for the second quarter of  are officially released next week they will show that fox news reclaimed the top spot among viewers in their mids through mids those of greatest interest to news advertisers according to estimates from nielsen media research  during the first three months of the year by contrast cnn drew so many viewers on big democratic primary nights and for several presidential debates that it vaulted over fox news for the first time in six years but the backandforth these last few months masks a more ominous trend for fox news particularly as its gears up to cover the general election campaign the most dominant cable news channel for nearly a decade and a political force in its own right fox has seen its once formidable advantage over cnn erode in this presidential election year as both cnn and msnbc have added viewers at far more dramatic rates in the first fiveandahalf months of  the last presidential election year foxs primetime audience among viewers aged  to  was more than double that of cnns     to  according to estimates from nielsen media research this year through midjune cnn erased the gap and drew nearly as many viewers in that demographic category as fox    about  for cnn to  for fox  meanwhile cnn has added  viewers a night on average when compared with the last presidential year while fox has shed about  according to nielsen msnbc which added  viewers in that audience much of it courtesy of gains by countdown with keith olbermann still lagged in third place with    i dont think its that fox has slipped said scott reed a republican strategist who managed bob doles presidential campaign in  i just think msnbc and cnn have risen to the occasion in a far more creative way with better guests cooler maps and more interactive shows i like olbermann added mr reed who is both a friend of senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee and a donor to his campaign he may be a bleeding liberal and i dont agree with his harshness toward republicans but i find his show entertaining and informative  while fox news remains the mostwatched cable news channel over all  it has been attracting an average of nearly  million viewers each weeknight this year compared to  million for cnn and  for msnbc  its momentum has effectively stalled at least when measured over years past the overall primetime audiences watching cnn and msnbc by contrast have each grown by more than  percent this year when measured against the same period last year while foxs has increased by  percent according to nielsen the new york times and nbc news the parent of msnbc share some resources in covering political news a fox news spokeswoman dana klinghoffer refused several requests this week for comment about the channels ratings and strategy to be sure the protracted nature of the race for the democratic nomination which extended months past that of the republican race tended to work to the disadvantage of fox which tilts overtly to the right on primetime programs like the oreilly factor and hannity  colmes while fox had no democratic debates cnn drew  million viewers for its democratic candidates debate on jan  more than six  times its usual primetime audience similarly on big democratic primary nights    which tended to be clustered in the first three months of the year    cnn routinely outdrew fox news with msnbc sometimes coming in second over the last three months as senator barack obama secured his hold on the democratic nomination viewership on all three cable news channels fell with cnn losing the most viewers about  percent when compared with the first three months of this year according to nielsen estimates i would think democratic viewers would be more inclined to go to cnn said carl forti executive vice president for issue advocacy for freedoms watch a conservative organization at the same time theres been no republican primary since feb   and there hasnt been a lot going on on the republican side to drive republicans to political coverage  but disproportionate interest in the democratic campaign alone cannot explain the struggles of fox relative to years past and the gains of its competitors cnn and msnbc have somehow managed to photocopy several pages from the playbook of roger ailes the founder of fox news and its chairman whose emphasis on sharp opinions glitzy graphics and big personalities has been taken to heart by competitors like cnns anderson cooper mr olbermann and his running mate on msnbc chris matthews what ailes would say is theyre following our lead said bob kerrey the president of the new school in manhattan and a former democratic senator from nebraska there is a certain element of truth to that but mr kerrey argued by making themselves more compelling and entertaining to watch cnn and msnbc put themselves in a far better position than fox news to capture those young voters who were paying attention to a presidential campaign particularly the race for the democratic nomination for the first time meanwhile foxs hosts have seemed to struggle on camera to find a new voice three times in less than three weeks in late spring fox acknowledged making inappropriate references to mr obama the presumptive democratic nominee it said on june  that it should not have referred in an onscreen headline to mr obamas wife michelle as his baby mama previously a fox anchor e d hill apologized for likening a seemingly affectionate fist bump by the obamas at a rally to a terrorist fist jab and a fox analyst liz trotta expressed contrition for making a joke about a possible assassination of mr obama those comments notwithstanding a pillar of foxs strategy at least in the weeks since mr obama vanquished senator hillary rodham clinton has been to bash him relentlessly on monday night for example the viewer did not even have to listen to an interview that sean hannity and alan colmes conducted on their primetime program with dick morris a fox contributor who has written a new book fleeced at least partly about the obama campaign during the interview the screen flashed continuously with dire warnings set off in quotation marks  obama would take this country to the far left obama would open the door to illegal immigrants obama would lower penalties for dangerous drug criminals obamas tax plan might trigger a stock market crash  apparently distilled from mr morriss book  mr mccain a republican whose candidacy has not sat well with some conservatives has not so much gotten a boost from foxs primetime programs as  an occasional pass more than bragging rights among the cablenews channels are at stake brad adgate senior vice president of research at horizon media an ad buyer said he recently crunched the primetime nielsen data for the first half of the year on his own and came away with reservations about foxs performance i think that there is some concern there mr adgate said while theyre still the toprated network the gap has closed he added what strategy are they going to embark on to rebuild the momentum they had in  still no one is ready to count out mr ailes or fox news the proof is going to be once the political season is over mr adgate said can cnn sustain the momentum they have or to put it in political terms he added is this going to have coattails'

VONE spell was broken and another cast: the world's most beloved clown became his adopted land's most reviled figure. As the cold war coalesced in 1947, Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp mutated into the monstrous Monsieur Verdoux, a professional bigamist and serial killer supporting his family by marrying and dispatching a succession of wealthy widows. ''Monsieur Verdoux,'' opening Friday for a weeklong run at Film Forum, is subtitled ''A Comedy of Murders,'' and, as the French critic Andr Bazin observed, it turns the Chaplin universe upside down. The erstwhile tramp is here an honest bank clerk driven to homicide by the 1929 stock market crash. Condemned to death at the movie's end, he declares his crimes paltry compared with those of Western civilization: ''As a mass killer, I'm an amateur by comparison.''

monstrous monsieur verdoux a professional bigamist and serial killer supporting his family by marrying and dispatching a succession of wealthy widows monsieur verdoux opening friday for a weeklong run at film forum is subtitled a comedy of murders and as the french critic andr bazin observed it turns the chaplin universe upside down the erstwhile tramp is here an honest bank clerk driven to homicide by the  stock market crash condemned to death at the movies end he declares his crimes paltry compared with those of western civilization as a mass killer im an amateur by comparison chaplin considered this his first postworld war ii movie a topical one as he had satirized adolf hitler in the great dictator  he would now comment on the carnage hitler provoked and the mass destruction he feared would follow von clausewitz said that war is the logical extension of diplomacy chaplin told an interviewer verdoux  feels that murder is the logical extension of business but monsieur verdoux was also the logical result of chaplins feelings of victimhood as a celebrity and a man although enormously popular the great dictator had not been without controversy it was denounced as interventionist propaganda on the senate floor the stormier reception for monsieur verdoux reflected both the films content and the filmmakers character  throughout the war chaplin was under attack for his morals  in the form of a sensational paternity suit  and political sympathies for some the two were identical representative john e rankin a mississippi democrat denounced chaplin as a communist notorious for his forcible seduction of white girls even before monsieur verdoux opened in april  the hollywood columnist hedda hopper wrote to j edgar hoover the fbi director begging him for an opportunity to attack the star you give me the material and ill blast  hoover who demurred did have a hefty file on chaplin including a recent report associating him with the radical migrs hanns eisler and bertolt brecht but monsieur verdoux  which was surely influenced by brechts notions of social satire  brought its own disaster  to introduce the film his first movie in seven years chaplin insisted on a series of news conferences before the premiere he entertained friendly questions from foreign journalists the screening itself at the refitted broadway theater in manhattan was less cordial taken aback by audience hissing chaplin fled the scene  at a subsequent meeting with reporters in the gotham hotels packed grand ballroom he encountered even greater animosity half the questions concerned his politics or national loyalty he was accused of being a communist sympathizer and questioned about his friendship with eisler then the prime target of the house unamerican activities committees evolving investigation into communism in hollywood the next day monsieur verdoux received the worst notices of chaplins career attacked as unfunny tasteless poorly made morally dubious and per the new york heraldtribune an affront to the intelligence but the reviews were not uniformly hostile characterizing the movie as basically serious and bitter bosley crowther of the new york times warned that those who go expecting to laugh at it may find themselves remaining to weep for some the film became a cause  james agee wrote a threepart defense in the nation  although it wasnt much help that the most unambiguously positive review ran in the daily worker a brilliant comedy whose deep message will stir the hearts and minds of libertyloving peoples all over the world monsieur verdoux lasted less than a month at the broadway and soon after the independent theater owners of ohio called for a national ban united artists withdrew the movie from release by midjune representative rankin was demanding chaplins deportation expecting to be brought before the house unamerican activities committee chaplin linked his movie to the impending investigation he sent an open telegram to the committees chairman suggesting that he simply view the movie it is against war and futile slaughter he wrote i am not a communist i am a peacemonger  few films have been as polarizing the day after catholic war veterans urged a federal investigation into chaplins political activities the national board of review voted monsieur verdoux best picture of   for all its intellectual defenders however monsieur verdoux grossed a pitiful  at the box office thus humiliated chaplin refused to allow the movie to be revived by the time it reappeared at the plaza theater in july  with chaplin long since relocated to switzerland it was a filmbuff legend greeted with anticipatory excitement and capacity crowds  rereleased within months of the apocalyptic farce dr strangelove and with senator barry goldwater the presumptive republican presidential candidate chaplins dark comedy struck a responsive chord the village voice critic andrew sarris linked this contemporary acceptance to the popularization of sick humor if  audiences were too reluctant to laugh at the cruelty in monsieur verdoux todays crowds may be too eager while never enjoying the canonical status of the gold rush or city lights monsieur verdoux did rise in critical esteem over the course of a long and unpopular war the movies fortunes have since faded but learning that its american rights had lapsed a brooklyn film programmer jacob perlin managed to relicense them mr perlin  said he was struck by the films prescience citing the governments murderous public policy and the profits generated by corporations like halliburton and blackstone monsieur verdoux may once again be timely but the audacity of its statement derives less from chaplins antiwar polemic than from his antiheroic pose no star ever took a greater risk with his public image or more directly challenged his audience if chaplin ridiculed hitler by transforming him into the little tramp he did something far more disturbing in socializing the little tramp by his very existence bazin noted verdoux renders society guilty approaching eternity the convicted killer subtly reverts to the tramps distinctive gait has humanity sunk to this in the movies ultimate gag it becomes apparent that as bazin wrote theyre going to guillotine charlie   j hoberman is senior film critic for the village voice'

VTHE downfall of Bear Stearns, the release of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's sweeping blueprint for the overhaul of our financial regulatory structure, and the worsening health of the stock market and our economy has raised serious questions for the future of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the capital-markets regulator and investor's advocate, the S.E.C. is a natural recipient of finger-pointing during a market crisis. Each of us led the S.E.C. during challenging times -- the stock market crash of 1987, the price-fixing scandal at Nasdaq in the 1990s, and the accounting and governance failures and mutual fund scandals of this decade. We are in agreement with Secretary Paulson that the world of finance is changing rapidly, having eclipsed in many areas the regulatory structure put in place, piece by piece, over the past century. Yet we fear that the current conversation about the future of the S.E.C. is getting ahead of itself. Secretary Paulson's proposals to change the structure and function of the S.E.C., if adopted, risk inflicting serious damage to investors and our capital markets.

jones industrial average surged more than  percent or nearly  points  they were also encouraged by announcements that ubs of switzerland is close to raising  billion in fresh capital and lehman brothers is close to raising  billion a sign that investors have not given up on banks   even so some analysts say that the optimism may be premature reflecting wishful thinking more than economic realities  the market has been consistently wrong each time they tried to find a bottom said meredith whitney an analyst at oppenheimer  company noting that earlier stock rallies in january and last fall were overwhelmed by more bad news  theres a hooray from the stands but investors dont realize the bench has been weakened she said theres no end in sight in terms of bad news indeed a report issued tuesday by morgan stanley concluded that investment banks face their worst crisis in  years surpassing the global financial upheavals of  as well as the stock market crash of  it projected that investment banking revenue will drop another  percent this year and financial firms will report a further  billion in markdowns on top of what they have announced so far  there have been several false dawns during this crisis said lawrence h summers who confronted the financial shocks of the late s as treasury secretary under president bill clinton one cant be at all confident the worst of this is behind us but mr summers added that recent actions by the federal reserve combined with bargain prices for certain financial assets might be enough to permit a process of repair to begin  other market watchers noted that tuesdays big stock market move was different in important ways from previous rallies   tuesday represented one of the biggest rallies weve had that wasnt on fed steroids said james w paulsen chief investment strategist of wells capital management in minneapolis alluding to rate cuts the federal reserve made in recent months what were in the process of doing is putting in a

achieving doubledigit earnings gains he said referring to the standard  poors stock index reaction to the news of fresh capital for lehman and ubs was quite good said tobias levkovich a longtime stock market strategist at citigroup does it mean all the problems are behind us no but it suggests the market is willing to look past the valley to some degree  from a high last october of  to its low of  last month the s p  fell  percent that is close to the  percent median decline stocks have experienced over the last nine recessions mr levkovich said even so enormous losses keep piling up germanys biggest bank deutsche bank said tuesday that it would take a  billion writedown because of the subprime crisis and warned that market conditions have become significantly more challenging during the last few weeks  that writedown while large paled in comparison to the  billion charge that ubs announced tuesday that brought ubss total writedowns to nearly  billion  more than any other banks  and ubs expects to post a firstquarter loss of  billion but its plan to raise new capital quashed fears that the bank based in zurich was facing deeper threats because of the subprime woes ubss financial woes caused another casualty however in its executive suite ubss longtime chairman marcel ospel abruptly resigned tuesday after months of criticism from shareholders last summer peter wuffli the banks chief executive was among the first of a series of highprofile financiers to be forced out by subprime losses now with mr ospels departure ubs has joined american giants like merrill lynch and citigroup in cleaning house at the top ubs said its general counsel peter kurer would succeed mr ospel lehman brothers  the investment firm hit by worries about its ability to weather the downturn is already close to raising  billion in fresh funds from investors that is far more than the  billion it said it would seek which analysts read as evidence of confidence in its future  financial stocks

S'in light of recent events i present to you steins laws of modern financial markets    the quantity me is always greater than the variable u   the constant m for money is always greater than the variable t for truth   in any otherwise inexplicable financial event the people who profit from it may be understood to have caused it  lets start at the beginning as far as we know to date  and this could well change  we are not in a recession unemployment is far below recession levels as are new claims for unemployment payments the number of hours worked has barely budged from its highs in the most recent reporting quarter the fourth quarter of  there was still positive economic growth though barely unless a recession is whatever a reporter or a pundit calls it it is two consecutive quarters of economic decline that is the historical definition by the national bureau of economic research and we dont yet have a better one  in other words we wont know until summer whether we are in for  a recession we may well be and nothing would be less surprising but as a matter of definition we simply cannot be in one yet  corporate profits are not at the peak levels of late and early and mid but they are still very high by historical standards this too will surely change but it hasnt yet and we have no good way to predict how much the change will be there is only one really weak sector housing but its coming off of roughly five years of unparalleled boom and has always been highly cyclical agriculture minerals extraction and refining and almost all exports are startlingly strong in other words the realworld economy of the nation is not bad there is however a serious disconnect when we move over to the world of the financial markets where chaos reigns there is havoc in the brave new world of trading securitized mortgages this is said to result from startling losses in the subprime mortgage market and surely some of it does but the fall in the indexes that measure subprime mortgages dwarfs the actual losses so far in those mortgages  or even the predicted losses there is havoc in the market for municipal bonds though there has not been one notable muni default in at least five years unless it happened while i was in a deep sleep there is total anarchy in the market for muni and corporateauction shortterm securities even though again there has not been one notable default and there is trembling in corporate bonds though the default rate on these  even on junk corporates  is at a historic low and close to nil yet the stock and credit markets reel the investment banks teeter and one falls into a cruel grave the fed steps in with ever more liquidity and reassurances and the markets still gyrate wildly even great experts proclaim they dont understand this market here is a stab at it whats new this time isnt the scope of the subprime losses we had far worse losses in the technology crash whats new is not the collapse of a junk class of securities we had that when the milken empire collapsed and the economy hardly budged the new part is the hedge funds and the changing of wall street from a financing entity to a market manipulation entity the new part is hedge funds with supposedly  trillion in capital immense hedge funds within banks and investment banks the new part is that they have so much money and so much selling power that they can do what capitalists really want and love to do to make money not by betting on the markets but by controlling the markets by putting so much sell side and occasionally buy side firepower in play that they know they will move the markets this takes all that annoying uncertainty out of it  the task of the hedge funds is to find a weak spot in the market and to put so much pressure on it that they can move it down scare other players into selling with the endless help of guileless journalists wreak havoc with the markets indexes and then create that much more selling once the process starts rolling its shooting fish in a barrel just think of what the short sellers did to bear stearns its true that bear stearnss fabled risk management was not up to par in its portfolio but its also true that without the hedge fund heavies of great wealth and great gossip beating them to the ground bear would surely have shlepped it through as we say how do i know this is happening first its the only explanation that fits the facts second its human nature third much of it has been reported i am just putting it together and turning it into laws of finance this is important for two reasons one if market manipulators terrify the banks lending will slow and the economy will really falter it wont be rumor it will happen  second as the hedge funds change the stock market into a chamber of horrors the retirement hopes of tens of millions of americans will be dashed and the stock market as a place for sensible americans to place their money for longterm growth will be destroyed the stock market will be just a place for the sharks to eat one another instead of eating us little fish as they have been doing lately to be fair they also eat one another when they can and do not always act in concert by any means  but when they do look out below what to do laws requiring far more transparency in hedge fund trading are needed they need to be enforced and second there are laws against schemes and artifices to defraud the current securities and exchange commission basically ignores them  it just might be time to use them careful and prudent investigation of market manipulation would calm the waters at present we have basically turned over the securities markets to the crips and the bloods its time to reclaim them for semidecent people  ben stein is a lawyer writer actor and

VTHE dollar's sharp drop over the last two years has been a huge boon for Americans who bought foreign stocks. But now many market strategists are cautioning investors that the principle would hold true in reverse if the dollar switched course for an extended stretch: a sharp rise in the dollar would cut into foreign stock returns. While these strategists are not saying the dollar will erase all its losses anytime soon, they say it has probably hit bottom and may even be on the rebound.

S'the dollars sharp drop over the last two years has been a  huge boon for americans who bought foreign stocks but now many market strategists are cautioning investors that the principle would hold true in reverse if the dollar switched course for an extended stretch a sharp rise in the dollar would cut into foreign stock returns while these strategists are not saying  the dollar will erase all its losses anytime soon they say it has probably hit bottom and may even be on the rebound those people who are waiting for the dollar to crash should wake up and smell the coffee because it has already happened said ed yardeni president of yardeni research in great neck ny  he predicted that the dollar would strengthen in   especially when compared with  currencies against which it has lost the most ground those include   the euro the british pound and the canadian dollar those three currencies have been painfully strong in recent months to the point where central bankers are either thinking about or starting to lower interest rates mr yardeni said certainly most strategists are not suggesting that americans bail out of foreign investments they say that it is a good idea to be globally diversified even if a rise in the dollar  trims future foreign returns i dont think the currency is going to hurt you that much over the next couple of years its just not going to help you mr yardeni said  but he said those who  owned foreign stocks in the last two years  when the dollars decline supercharged returns  might need to rebalance portfolios  mr yardeni recommends that american investors put  to  percent of their stock portfolios into foreign shares some strategists recommend a smaller allocation perhaps  to  percent after pouring money into mutual funds that own foreign stocks americans started making net withdrawals from these funds in midnovember according to amg data services still european stock funds have been popular with americans in recent years and for good reason the european stock fund category has had average annual returns of more than  percent over the last five years according to morningstar but  currency values caused a large part of that performance stuart a schweitzer the global markets strategist at jpmorgan private bank has been particularly bullish on european stocks for years but lately that  enthusiasm has begun to cool i think european growth is likely to slow weighed down by the strong euro high oil prices and slower us growth he said i think it is time for investors to consider taking profits on some of their european equities michael joynson a director for global equities at citi global wealth management a citigroup unit said he did  not expect the dollar to strengthen nearly as much as some strategists have forecast citigroup economists predict  that the dollar will fall a bit more against the euro early this year but will end  at  around  near its current level in that case mr joynson said exchange rates may squeeze european carmakers and pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of their sales in the united states but he said european companies in  industries having most of their sales in europe  like  utilities telecommunications and retailing  should be relatively unhurt by the lofty euro komal srikumar chief global strategist at the tcw group a fund management company based in los angeles is among strategists who predict that the dollar will rise  sharply this year i think the big story of  will be the strengthening of the dollar mr srikumar said he recommends underweighting stocks in the euro zone and in britain while overweighting emerging markets whose currencies have not risen sharply he also predicted that emergingmarket economies would continue to grow despite a slowdown in the united states and europe other strategists are less confident about the prospects for developing countries theyve got a lot of internal investment demand but they still sell  percent of their exports to the united states and europe said david darst the chief investment strategist in morgan stanleys global wealth management group  mr darst was particularly cautious about chinese and indian stocks which have already risen sharply but he was less worried about emerging markets with oilbased economies among big  foreign stocks he favors petrobras the brazilian oil giant it recently made a huge oil discovery off of brazils coast mr darst also recommends investing in  largecapitalization american stocks particularly companies that make consumer products with global brands we are telling people to focus on consumer staples  the colgates of the world the cocacolas of the world he said adding pepsico procter  gamble and johnson  johnson to the list he said such global giants should flourish even with a relatively weak dollar and a global economic slowdown '

VWITHOUT trust, there can be no free-market capitalism. Capitalism took root in Europe when wealthy families had excess income to invest, and they entrusted their money to managers who would treat their funds with due care. Such standards of care required that those handling someone else's money behave with extreme rigor and honesty. The standards, which came to be known as fiduciary duty, were the same duty a court required of, say, a trustee dealing with the property of a widow or a child.

S'without trust there can be no freemarket capitalism capitalism took root in europe when wealthy families had excess  income  to invest and they entrusted their money to managers who would treat their funds with due care  such standards of care required that those handling someone elses money behave with extreme rigor and honesty the standards which came to be known  as fiduciary duty were the same duty a court required of  say a trustee dealing with the property of a widow or a child  trustees always had to behave with the interests of the trustor uppermost  there could be no conflict of interest or even the appearance of one every relevant fact about an investment and a trusteeship had to be disclosed as the law came to be interpreted in the united states the trustee had to disclose every fact or belief that  might influence an intelligent reasonable investor these laws were codified in state and federal courts after  revelations of  stock market corruption before and during the crash of  there could be no material deception and  no scheme or artifice to defraud the investors interests always had to be superior to those of the investment bank  financial adviser or broker  for a good long time after world war ii  the laws of fiduciary duty were observed but by the s the law started to break down in a major way there had been small scandals in the s and s but by the end of the s the drexel burnhammichael milken junkbond scandals had exploded revealing that deception was routinely practiced against the buyers of junk bonds  then came the closely related savingsandloan scandals leaving taxpayers defrauded in a major way then we weathered the hightech scandals of the late s in which the bluest of the bluechip brokerage firms and investment banks placed excessive valuations on companies that they peddled to investors these investors were often in a trustortrustee relationship they suffered losses on a scale never before seen and yet almost no one was punished now we have the collateralized mortgage obligations and their attendant losses in the subprime mortgage mess the problem is a familiar one basic  hocuspocus about what the securities were worth of course there was boilerplate in all of the offerings saying that anything could happen but that boilerplate is so ubiquitous and covers so much that it  has come to mean nothing what did mean something was the name of the underwriter selling the securities  if it was a big name a name redolent of power and antiquity a buyer could assume that it  could be trusted  of course as we know now that turned out to be wrong  the biggest of the big names were among the most aggressive in betraying their clients trust as i see it some of the biggest names were selling securities that they  apparently  barely understood themselves in so doing they exposed their buyers  and their stockholders  to immense losses think merrill lynch bear stearns lehman brothers and many others  other major players including  goldman sachs were aggressively shorting the very same sort of products they were underwriting  now goldman can spin this as risk management and insist that it was doing it to protect its stockholders remember though that   goldmans lushly compensated traders and executives get a far larger share of the pie than we pitiful stockholders do but selling short the same securities or very similar ones that they were peddling to the clients is extremely hard to reconcile with basic fairness goldman asserts that it did nothing wrong in its handling of cmos saying that most of the entities that bought them were highly sophisticated and capable of making their own investment decisions goldman declined to show me a list of its large buyers it also offered no opinion
